/title/tt0118767/,"In what may have been Sergei Bodrov Jr's most famous role before his untimely death - he got killed in a landslide while filming a movie in 2002 - he plays an outcast from a small Russian town who moves to St. Petersburg, where he becomes a hit-man. ""Brat"" (the Russian word for brother) has some pretty ugly imagery, but nothing gratuitous. The scenes in which Danila goes to McDonald's represent his life: it's fast food, and he lives fast. The streetcar represents the fleeting nature of his love life. The scene where he washes his hands in the water suggests that he is washing away his sins (although he will probably never be able to fully escape his actions during his time in St. Pete).I certainly recommend this movie. Partially a look at conditions in post-Soviet Russia*, it pulls no punches. You'll likely want to avoid it if you're the squeamish type. There was a sequel, but it apparently wasn't worth seeing.*People in Moscow have told me that under Yeltsin, nothing worked right in Russia, and so they like that Putin and Medvedev at least fixed that aspect.",7,4 April 2009," brother courage

/title/tt0118767/,"This Russian film about a young hitman in St. Petersburg could just as easily have been set in London or New York; killing for profit's the same everywhere, isn't it, and yet Aleksey Balabanov's terrific thriller ""Brother"" seems peculiarly Russian. You wouldn't really find these characters in London or New York and what happens here wouldn't necessarily happen there, at least not in this fashion.Danila, (Sergey Bodrov, excellent) is a young ex-soldier who gets into trouble at home so his mother packs him off to live with his older, well-off brother in St. Petersburg. The thing is, however, big brother is a hitman and very soon Danila is, too. The thrills Balabanov serves up aren't the ones you expect. This is a character study like Melville's ""Le Samourai"" but our young anti-hero is a rank amateur compared with Delon, although he does know his way around a gun. Danilo thinks he's a big shot but he's just another young boy with a passion for rock music, (the film has a terrific score). Even the ending isn't the conventional one. See this.",8,1 October 2021," This tale of Russian gangsters isn't what you expect.

/title/tt0118767/,"Set in St. Petersburg, where the fall of communism has led to a sort of wild west anarchy between competing sections of the Russian mafia. Into this steps a young man fresh out of Army service, who comes to stay with his older brother who (as it turns out) is himself a hit man. Before long, the younger brother has taken over for the older, and is coolly and efficiently killing off targets and double crossing bosses alike. Sort of a combination art film and gangster action film, this never does much more than entertain, and there's a certain phony James Bond quality to some of the violence.

/title/tt0118767/,"Anyone who has seen Balabanov's eerie OF FREAKS AND MEN may be shocked by this very straightforward thriller about a young army deserter who becomes an efficient killer.  Its tale of betrayal is reminiscent of ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, and Danila is also very much like The Man With No Name, a motiveless stranger pitting two enemies against each other until they are wiped out.  The opening sequence (sparse forest, castle, robed woman, intimations of S&M) suggest Gothic,as does a certain burial sequence, but, try as we might, we cannot get away from the sheer amoral banality: a gloriously unneurotic hero, a sweet boy who does everything people of his age should (loitering, discman, drugs, concerts, parties etc.) and just happens to be handy with a gun (he is also the only worker in this former worker's paradise).",6,27 July 2000," Unsettling precisely because it's not.

/title/tt0118767/,"I haven't seen a crime movie with action more realistic than is, and can guarantee you that neither have you.This movie emphasizes that when you get shot you can't run as fast as a cheetah unlike the Hollywood films portray every day. The movie is multi-layered (you can watch in as an action movie), a social analysis of the period, even a Dostoevsky-like study on the value of brotherhood and after all, a unique picture of what Russia is, was, and will be.The story is told brilliantly the main character Danila, doesn't tell or brag about his past, he actually makes himself out to be a humble guy, instead of saying he served in the hot spot in the war and was given recognition and bravery award for saving his platoon members, he often reminds people that he was far from combat, he is passionate and caring and not aggressive at all.If you were in S. Petersburgh in the early nineties, you feel this movie has been able to grab a cubic meter of air of the city at that time, pack it, and give it to its viewers to breathe.filled with excellent performances, especially by Sergei Bodrov III and Yuri Kutznetsov.

/title/tt0118767/,"You will be marinated in Russian-ness after watching this gritty crime drama shot in St. Petersburg. Set in the early 1990s after the fall of Soviet communism, it's a movie whose co-star is the place. The crime and gunplay in the foreground, which cropped up after the collapse of stern authority, seems to perfectly match what we see in the background -- trash-strewn streets, grimy flats, drug-fueled nightclubs. Everyone is poor or barely getting by. Even the gangsters, who you'd think would have some Scarface-type perks, seem to live in squalor.One thing that will instantly strike you is how everyone in the movie looks like someone you know, not a Hollywood star. I want to call particular attention to Svetlana Pismichenko, the film's love interest, who plays the driver of a streetcar that hauls lumber (?). She's not pretty at all, but you see the love she is capable of and, all I can say is I wish she were my girlfriend. Her last scene is one of the most memorable portraits of heartbreak I have ever seen. She has incredible eyes.Sergei Bodrov plays the lead, a soldier just back from Chechnya who is drawn into his brother's gangland activities. We never see a flashback of what happened over there and, when asked by others in the film what he did, grins and said he was a clerk in HQ. As we come to see the fearlessness and ruthlessness he is capable of, it is obvious he is lying. This man is steel tempered in a furnace. His gangster enemies are no match for a man with his willingness to prepare for and face death.I've never been to Russia, but I lived in the Czech Republic for three years and I can testify to the authenticity of this movie's backdrop. When the Iron Curtain fell, it revealed decaying rust belt cities, but also a tough-minded population of attractive and spirited people who, somehow, found ways to be happy in tough times. I am American and half Polish, and this movie made me proud to be a Slav.A scene in the movie is a homage to Russian good cheer. It is a party in a Russian flat where a few dozen people are chatting, eating, smoking pot, drinking vodka, singing along to a guitar, shooting pool and having fun. They're all young people in their 20's. You'll wish you were at that party.",9,17 May 2010," Russians!

/title/tt0118767/,This is a movie aimed at a youthful Russian audience with rock music drugs sex and a hero who knocks off Russian Gangsters and makes hoods pay for their tram fares. It shows the new underworld fast lane of Russia in 1997--with its shocking decadence (to Russian audiences).I enjoyed the first 30 minutes or so of it as it is so different and the action was pretty exciting. But then it begins to drag...it needed some editing and a clearer explanation of the story line. What happened exactly during the first killing? Who were the people in the Volvo? Why did his brother turn on him? I suppose if you watched it 2 or 3 times you could catch the story but who wants to see those party scenes again and the skeleton trolley (what function does such a trolley serve?--kind of neat image) going up and down the street and a lot of other excess baggage....just some editing is all that is needed.Also it is filmed in a sepia that is also something you might not want to put yourself through again.Lots of potential.. I am sure it was popular and more versions of this hero will follow--the hero is headed for Moscow in the last scene. But am not sure I want to sign on....this one was fun will look for more from this director rather than sequels.The music kind of makes this thing work but am not interested in purchasing the sound track any more than watching this thing twice.Reading on the internet I discovered Bodrov the protagonist is the son of Bodrov Sr. the director; he is now deceased from an avalanche accident...so there will be no more sequels starring him.

/title/tt0118767/,"Brat(1997) and Brat 2 (2000) are two smoking hot Russian neo-noir crime film coming straight from Saint Petersburg, Russia.Unlike their American Counterparts with lot of glamour and spice, these two stay in the streets with the most realism you can find showing real street thugs and fights.Calling it a mafia movie may not do these justice and shift the focus of the viewers completely from its realistic approach to show a normal person entering into the world of Crime.The Search for 'Nautilus' s Wings' is strong and so is the blood for revenge. The movies don't show direct big action sequences or killings and cut right before them or change the camera angle, allowing for the viewer to interprete on their own, but not completely as it stratergically crafts the scene up to show most while showing minimum.The Handling of Guns and their modification just before a hit are satisfying in a new scense, it is not like tuco making his custom revolver in 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", you get to see making of bullets, shotgun shells, bombs, sawed of rifles etc.The second part like most other films is not an downgrade but in many sense an Upgrade, which gives you the feeling of' Coming to America' Russian Style.The portrayal of Russians are also human, not like the americans showing a big man fighting bear while Drinking Vodka bare handed,
Or an Mafia Manic with Ak-47 and shotgun, shooting everybody up in his path.
Showing a Hitman movie like it should be Shown, with mlre tension and planning and not 'boom bam-over'.

/title/tt0118767/,"Anything you wanted to know about that ""strange russian soul"" is in this movie but I doubt anybody will treat it like a piece of useful information.

When you try to instill new rules in them they make you think they follow the script when they actually don't.

The main character in Brother is not a lost soul in historical turbulence as many here suggest. On the contrary, the no-law-zone is the only comfortable environment for him. It gives him a purpose and a mission. No salary or stable office job can substitute that for him. He is a hitman without benifits of being a hitman, without customers or bosses.

However, given the seamy nature of the subject matter, this isn't a bad thing.

It is this shift in power that provided, for me, the greatest interest in the film.

/title/tt0118767/,"This is a great movie with alot of violence.  Throughout the movie there are long stretches of Danila making explosives, sawing off a shot gun, and fashioning weapons, with Nau music playing.  The rest of the movie consists mainly of him using these weapons at his job as a hitman.  Make no mistake, there is depth to this film.  It is more than an excuse to show violence.Danila is an interesting character.  At the ame time he blows away people regularly with no remorse and little thought.  Its his job, may as well do it well. I watched this as part of a film series at college in the original Russian, and the group of Russians sitting behind me laughed at many points.  The laughter confused me a bit, but the second time I saw it was pretty funny, and not in the usual one liner sense of action movies.

/title/tt0118767/,"It may not qualify to be a great movie, but it is surely a very good one, and quite an impressive portrait of the post-communist Russian society.  Oh yea, the main character Danila is quite a ""character.""  A very likable guy (though he ""dislikes jews and film directors,"" not to mention America and anyone from the Caucases, but he is cool with Germans - go figure), likes Nautilus Pompilius, very kind too (when he has the money, he is always ready to share), somewhat dimwitted but at the same time very prompt and knows what's cooking.  He obviously was in Chechen war but always dodges the questions about his army experience because, er, it's repugnant to him.  So he is all that and he is also a cold blooded killer with no remorse.  Man, Dostoyevskiy must be turning in his grave!  But can you really judge Danila? He embodies a significant part of Russian society. A good thing about the movie is that director Aleksei Balabanov doesn't try to do it either, but lets the viewer decide on his/her own. Among other things the movie also boasts a unique St. Petersburgh atmosphere, an image of a self-sacrificing Russian woman (Danila's lover), a villain who constantly uses saying and proverbs in his speech, and, of course, a brief appearance by Mr. Butusov of Nautilus Pompilius fame. And let us not forget Danila's spiritual advisor of sort - the intellectual bum Nemetz, who definitely knew what he was talking about when he called the city an ""evil force."" I could go further with this review, but why don't you just see this movie for yourself...",,22 October 2000," BRAT

/title/tt0118767/,That is what makes BRAT real masterpiece of the film-making - it looks real to the last shot. Every moment is a true history of Post Soviet Russia. Even Ukraine was of that kind. We are kinda different now but not in 1990's. All the atmosphere is real - I was not very adult then but I remember everything of the 1990's clearly - I was 17 when the movie was made and this movie was a call of reality for everyone here. You don't have to say it is impossible - we had people killed like that... Sergey Bodrov is a good actor and all the actors in the movie are great. The music of Nautilus makes the atmosphere of being there just at the moment of the story development. This band was on the top of it's popularity at the moment of the middle 1990's. There are a lot of people here allover the Post Soviet places who are fans of the band.Any way - this movie is about some real aspects of real Post Soviet history.,10,5 February 2007," Total Reality in the movie

/title/tt0118767/,"My Russian friends told me to avoid this film, that it wasn't good. But I tend to trust IMDb ratings over word of mouth or what friends think. I should have listened. I've only seen a few Russian movies, but this one is by far the only one that has been terrible thus far. There are too many technical flaws to over look. The editing is bad and the characters don't react in a way they should. It seems their actions and dialogue are the product of simply serving the main character's message and reputation. Ironically, many of the Russian films I have seen from the 80's and 70's are way ahead of their time. Good acting, good writing, good story telling. Fast forward 20 years and watch брат and you wonder if film making in Russia regressed 35 years over night. It simply does not hold up. The film is less than 2 hours, but it felt like 2 days.

/title/tt0118767/,"Let me start with the few positives for the film....Well, you get to see a gritty side of St. Petersburg, Russia-or 'Peter' as Danila's brother calls it. And I suppose you could say that the violence in the film is more realistic rather than stylised that one might find in a 'hollywood' film. But that doesn't save this film.From a technical stand point, the film is bad. There parts of the film that have no place, such as Dani's running in and out of music shops. Some of the sequences make you wonder if they should have been cut out, and the the fade outs of all the scenes look very amateur. There are a few sequences that could have been nice with better editing, like where Danil is making weapons, but ultimately they fall flat. The music was absolutely terrible. Worst music ever used in a movie. Some of the characters were interesting, though we don't spend enough time with most of them, and our main character is a dimwit, and possibly a sociopath.Why make a movie in which no character is worth sympathizing with, and score it with terrible music? Who knows? don't watch this.",3,14 October 2008," Do not waste your time

It meets the standards but doesn't exceed them.I watched this movie purely because of its influence on GTA IV, which is one of my favorite games of all-time...and I did not regret it, the plot is gripping, the writing is solid, the acting is good, its well paced and the low budget isn't noticeable...but its not going to blow your mind by any means, it honestly feels like a watered down version of Scorsese as it takes a lot from the style of Martin Scorsese but fails to reach the heights of his movies, despite its rating implying otherwise...but this movie is definitely worth your time as its well made and entertaining...just set your expectations right.",7,31 October 2021," A fun movie, nothing more, nothing less.

/title/tt0118767/,"A hit in Russia and inexplicably rated by buffs, this truly awful movie is a dim, messy endurance test. Though they are at the heart of the plot, Viktor's criminal connections are never explained, the acting is amateurish in the worst possible way, and the horrifying array of cable knitwear is too much for western eyes to take. Also a subplot involving a mesmerisingly awful synth rock band called Nautulis seems beamed in from another planet.
Viktor Sukhorukov, who would prove so effortlessly sinister in Balabanov's next project, ""Of Freaks and Men"" (where his character would again share his real name) is a skeletal, leering caricature, and the less said of Sergei Bodrov in the lead the better.

/title/tt0118767/,"This film is a picture of 90s. Unlike latest post-Soviet never-ending dumb movies and serials about ""brigades"", ""bratki"" and the same garbage, ""Brat"" is more or less realistic. Of course, I mean the spirit of those times, not that everyone had gun and shot bad guys on the streets. The feeling of hopelessness and deadlock. Freaks, poverty, ""new Russians"", former intelligentsia who had to stand on the streets or markets and sell all kinds of things - all that really happened in 90s. And ""Brother"" reflects that quite true. Bodrov (R.I.P.) is right for his character. Also there is no romanticizing of criminals, no stupid ""cop""-propaganda (we can see the both clichés in the above mentioned modern Russian potboilers) just a piece of a contemporary's life even though it is obvious grotesque.

/title/tt0118767/,"A memorial to Russia's anarchy during the late president Yeltsin times, shot in sepia colors, just like some other Balabanov movies. The film is focusing on the simple Russian lad (played by late Bodrov-Jr.) who's just got demobilized from the army. Everything's new to him in the big city of St. Petersburg where he comes to see his hit-man brother: Russian cult band Nautilus, mores of the new Russia, hectic imitation of the Western lifestyle, foreigners, drugs, and even the new Russian slang. He cannot tell the difference between English and French, doesn't like Jews and filmmakers. He tells everybody he was just a scribe at the headquarters, but definitely lies, demonstrating brilliant skills of a hit-man, quite surpassing those of his older ne'er-do-well cowardly brother (and doing jobs for him). A spectator of this movie from outside Russia, especially the one who doesn't hail from the Soviet Union, may think of Medieval Dark Ages into which Russia of the 90's was immersed. The ""mysterious Russian soul"" interlaced with interesting contemporary Russian rock legends soundtrack goes on to be depicted in ""Brat 2"", focusing on the same character Danila's adventures in the US, further emphasizing the difference of Russia's and America's mindsets. In 2005, Same filmmaker Aleksei Balabanov shot ""Zhmurki"" (""Blind Man's Bluff"") further mocking Russia's 90's period and further emphasizing the difference between that interim period Russia and and cold-blooded modern Russian Federation where same crimes are done in much slicker way.",7,15 September 2007," A memorial to Russia's anarchy

/title/tt0118767/,"It's very easy, especially for a non-russian person, to mistake ""Brat"" for just another action movie. It's true - the protagonist Danila is a criminal, he's surrounded by bandits and he's not shy too use his gun. But it's much more complicated.Infact, ""Brother"" resembles much more a time capsule of the ""Wild West"" years of the Russian 90s, a reflection of the Russian soul than a crime thriller. To understand this, one must know the context of the world this movie is playing in, though.In the 1990s, it looked like Russia was finished. The USSR had just dissolved. After being a socialist superpower for more than 70 years, Russia turned into a turbo-capitalist country where only the law of the strongest, the law of the jungle, applied. On the verge of a civil war, with local conflicts like in Chechnya flaring up, oligarchs usurped what the vanished Soviet Union had left behind. Gangsters took advantage of the power vacuum that had arisen with the withdrawal of the state and fought each other for the biggest piece of the pie. Gang shootings occurred almost every day in every major city. Returning war veterans from Grozny, many drafted at the age of 18, had never learned anything in their lives but to kill and provided a constant supply for the mercenary armies of the gang bosses.One such veteran is our main character, Danila. Returning to his home, he keeps silent about what he has seen and done in the war, saying he never got to fight. Thus, his mother has no idea what he went through. She raves about his older brother Viktor, who, unlike him, would make himself useful making big money and tells Danila to visit him.Although his mother apparently refuses him the love that he would have particularly needed after his assignment in Chechnya, he accepts her advice. His behavior is reminiscent of a Russian proverb: If the whole family is together, the soul is also in place. Danila takes a train to the big city Saint Petersburg, which only recently was called Leningrad, and thus symbolizes the end of an old and the beginning of an new era. The crumbling facades of the old houses there reflect the state of the whole country. Finally he meets his older brother. It becomes clear that the child his mother was so proud of makes his living not the way she had imagined it: Viktor is a contract killer. Unlike Danila, he adapted himself to the new world they are living in - a world where money determines the value of a life. For Viktor, power lays in money, and thus it's only logical for him to immediately take advantage of his little brother and use him to do all kinds of dirty work. Danila, on the other hand, has a completely different character. For him, power lays in truth. He's a very simple and uneducated young man, can't tell America apart from France, but not dumb. He knows what his brother is up to. Although it becomes clear that Danila acquired significantly superior combat skills in Chechnya, he still does what his older brother wants - after all, Viktor is his own flesh and blood.Danila feels lost in the big city of Saint Petersburg. In one scene you see him buying CDs of his favorite rock band Nautilus, happy as a child, in another he's committing brute force. He is torn between the things he loves and his cruel surroundings. His peers make fun of his ""old-fashioned"" taste in music (which you can hear throughout the film) and naivety, while the elderly reject his violent way of life. He tries to protect the woman he fell in love with, but ends up only hurting her. What happens to him can be paraphrased in a dialogue he has with a Volga German with whom he befriends: ""You said that the city means power, but everyone here is weak."" - ""The city is an evil power. The strong come here, become weak. The city takes power. And now you are lost too.""""Brat"" is a story about a man who tries to keep his soul in a soulless world. It's a Russian cult movie and can be a unique experience - but only if you allow it to be so.",10,25 February 2021," A Russian Cult Film

/title/tt0118767/,"This film and its sequel have become cult classics of sorts within Russia, with many praising the excellent character writing and story. Outside of Russia though, this movie seems to be overlooked by many which is a shame because its a great crime film that I very much enjoyed watching.The film follows the character Danila, a young man who served in the Russian army during the Chechen war. He never saw any fighting during his time in the army, but is skilled at shooting and this results in him becoming involved in organised crime after moving to Saint Petersburg to see his older brother Viktor, who it turns out is a low-level gangster.Danila as a protagonist is very interesting, with a sense of morality that is not shared by any of the other criminals. However, as the film progresses we see that he is forced more and more to abandon these morals as he has no choice but to kill others. This loss of connection to others and their feelings culminates near the end of the film where he shoots the abusive husband of a woman that he likes against her wishes, and she forces him to leave as a result of this. Despite this, the ending seems rather hopeful, with Danila hitchhiking to Moscow after he realises that he can no longer stay in Saint Petersburg, and we're left to wonder what is in store for Danila in the future.Overall, Brother is one of the greats of Russian cinema and it should not be overlooked.",9,21 May 2021," A great crime drama that not enough people know about.

/title/tt0118767/,"We had a similar lawless period in Bulgaria (the closest satellite to ex-USSR), so I believe that the film is fully correct in this aspect. More important, however, is that of the thousands of films about crimes and criminals, only a few are more or less realistic; my work is closely related to the judicial system, so I know what I'm talking about. Even the real-crime TV shows lie somewhat, their cases carefully selected - always fully resolved, always black and white.

/title/tt0118767/,"'Brat' is a 1997 drama that made Sergei Bodrov a superstar and, following his tragic death shortly thereafter, a legend of Russian cinema. I remember my elder brother telling me to give it a try sometime around 2000, but it took me a further 15 years to get round to doing that.'Brat' has so much to offer in its 100 minutes of running time that it leaves a viewer breathless. An incredible portrayal of a Russia that is no more, excellent acting, a few rare moments of very dark (and very funny) Russian humour, fascinating drab landscapes of late-1990s Saint Petersburg, some of the best use of music I've ever seen in any film and a perfect ending. And lots, lots to think about once the closing credits start rolling.It's like a Russian response to 'The Godfather', made with a budget of $10,000. What an unforgettable film.

I liked the fact that not everything had to be explained to the audience. The director assumed that we were able to think for ourselves, i.e.; the lead character's 'true' past in the army. I don't believe that he was ""just a clerk at HQ"". I saw the DVD version, and watched the interview with the director. The film is even more amazing considering the shoestring budget. He got his friends to perform some of the acting roles as well as write and play the music (which was quite good). This is a great gritty film.

Young Danila (dim. from Danil/Daniil) returned from war with plainly simple perception: ""killing can solve the problem"" without even realising that it will cause other problems.Other aspects of ethics are fragmentarily gathered from official honesty, modesty, labour valour of soviet times and practical slyness and insubordination of soviet times. Add brotherhood here.And with this fragmented ethics and credo he encounters criminal world of Russia in 199x.Highly probably other cultures would not understand these inner Russian problems, as I did not understand problems of Columbia in Márquez's «Cien años de soledad». And the film really was not destined for outer world.Many people believe that Danila could be an etalon of purity and the right decisions about criminals (kind of Robin Hood's romantics for spectators). I suppose that those people are angry at life without possibility to change it, therefore saluting ultimate methods of J. Stalin.Personally, I think it's about broken youth of these war boys that made them not quite social, though honest.For those who did not understand it yet, Sveta pronounces this key-problem in plain Russian, at the end of the film.",10,17 January 2009," Broken ethics

/title/tt0118767/,"One could view this movie in several different ways: Russia's cry for its lost position of superpower, a rise of a superhero that takes care of evil forces and someone who Russian younglings can finally relate to, or simply as an entertaining action movie about mafia. The last one appeals to me most of all. Despite a fair amount of xenophobia in the movie, it is still nothing but a typical, at times subpar, superhero tale that has been recreated many times by Hollywood studios. In Hollywood, this movie would be nothing special, but since it's produced by Russian cinema it is put on a pedestal by Russian viewers who are not yet used to great films produced by their country. Xenophobic comments like ""kirdyk Amerike"" aimed towards a guy who is not even American, but clearly non-English speaking European adds up to non-significance of whatever is supposed to be symbolic in this movie. On the contrary, the music in this movie, performed by Russian cult band Nautilus Pompilius, deserves the highest notes, it's simply awesome. 'Brat 2' is next on my list, I heard it's better than the first one.",5,13 September 2005," A subpar movie by Hollywood standards but powerful for Russian cinema

/title/tt0118767/,"In the film ""Brat"", themes surrounding relationships and family take on broader meanings in Russian culture. The main character, Danila, returns to visit his brother Viktor at his mother's insistence. The relationship between the brothers is unlike what one would expect; Viktor even betrays Danila at one point. Danila does not make a real connection with anyone; by the end he has severed ties with everyone he had met. Interestingly, his actions form a parallel to Russia's attempts to leave behind the past and hint at possible attitudes toward other cultures.
The title ""Brother"" itself indicates that the relationship between the brothers is the most important in the film. Viktor was much like a father to Danila in the past, indicating that their relationship, while always close, had changed over the years. Viktor's character represents the past: he is successful only because of his criminal dealings, as many were during the Soviet days. Danila is pulled into these dealings of the past because he has no other direction, just as the present Russia was still unsure of where it was going. The past is well known and understood, even if it is not the best course of action. Danila kills other gangsters, who are clearly part of this past world: he operates within the system in order to destroy it. In many instances he must kill these individuals out of defense, just as certain aspects of the old Soviet culture had to be destroyed or they would ruin the new way of life Even Sveta's situation represents the past. Danila tries to free her from her abusive relationship, yet she is disgusted with the way he tries to help her. Similarly, many people might not be willing to kill off or sever ties with the past; it is the only life they have known.
Other people who Danila meets are similarly different forces acting on the culture; some of them could stand for foreign influences in Russia. The girl Ket exemplifies Western culture, particularly America: she likes to party and eat McDonalds. Ket's obsession with money also depicts the stereotypical American perspective. Danila eventually breaks off connection with her, giving her some money before leaving her. This attitude illustrates the fact that while the new Russia is open to the far western influence of America, the people do not necessarily want to accept this culture, nor is it a good idea for them to do so if they wish to maintain their own identity. Danila's relation to the German represents the general Russian relation to this western European country. Russia's relations with Germany have occasionally been somewhat tense, and the character points out ""what is good for the Russian is death for the German."" The German refuses the money that Danila offers him in the end, perhaps a statement that Germany (or maybe Europe in general) has no tolerance for the morally corrupt way of the old Soviet Union. Indeed, Danila brings the bodies to the graveyard where the German and others stay, urging him to give them a decent burial. It seems that the new Russia wants other Europeans to figuratively bury the past, and can not necessarily accomplish this task alone. However, the fact that Danila breaks off ties with the German shows a desire for Russia to deal with the past in its own way. Whether or not this will lead to trouble in the future is uncertain. Yet it seems that Danila is entirely capable of dealing with these problems on his own, even though the means by which he does so is not ideal in most eyes.",,11 May 2004," Personal and cultural connections in ""Brat""--- Note: this contains possible spoilers!

/title/tt0118767/,"This was more of a movie than any other gangster movies I have seen and I do not even speak Russian. If this is the city where Putin became Dep. Mayor then you can get an insight into Russia today. Putin must have got acting lessons from Sergei Bodrov Jr and Aleksie Balabanov (the star and director of this wonderful movie).The jokes, like accidentally 'photo bombing' ruining a film shoot at the beginning, are so very Russian but even I can laugh about them and I have no connection with Russia save for a love of the literature and art. This is Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Gorky on celluloid and even Tchaikovsky could not make a more fitting or apt score. So sad that the director and star have both gone to that great Soviet Union in the sky on krylya (wings) of .narrative epic.The fact that nobody tells the truth because nobody knows any truth is a very post communist joke but real too.The music by Nautilus Pompeius was spot on and totally in sympathy with the brooding mood of the film. I have watched this many times and am still trying to speak a few words of Russian because there are still things to find in the film.

/title/tt0118767/,"At first glance Brat, (Brother), comes across as a grim and humorless portrayal of post-Cold War Russia, but beneath the surface it is a strong critique of the dangerous wounded animal that the country has become: mass poverty, crime, alienation of the youth and failing family structure all act as dramatic catalysts in the system, adding to the problems and attitudes of 1990s Russia. Our vantage point revolves around the young Danila and follows through with his reintroduction to life outside the military, into the city. Although Danila is surrounded by the gloom and doom of the Communist aftermath where social structures are collapsing into near anarchy, he remains an allegorical symbol of the state of Russia's acute sense of right and wrong and offers hope for a brighter future and some semblance of a moral code.In St. Petersburg Viktor is successful, but we find that it is at being a hit-man for the Russian mafia, which is also making him paranoid. After tying up Dani in a scheme to take out a competitive Chechen mob boss in his stead while simultaneously usurping the Russians, Dani is now in over his head with the mob, and becomes a killer. Meanwhile each character Danila meets represents a different aspect of Russian culture and institutional disillusionment. He begins with Kat, a disaffected youth who only cares for him only for the money he has to buy acid and go raving. Later in the film, Dani goes out with Kat to do just that, and finds himself at a house party telling fellow inebriated foreigners, ""Soon all of your America will kick the bucket!"" When Kat tells him to stop badgering them because they're French, he replies with ""It's all the same."" Clearly, there is no thawing of Western resentment, even in the youth, daily indoctrinated by their seniors. It is only when Russians seek to find their own identity, not to emulate the capitalist West as Yeltsin's failed attempt of economic shock therapy sought to do, that there is a renewed sense of nationalistic pride. We see this again when two American tourists ask Danila for directions to a nearby club and he is disapprovingly silent. Danila's moral compass takes on some unorthodox manifestations as is not unlike the general occurrences of the city. On a public bus, a ticket-taker asks two men to either supply a ticket or provide the fee. As they disrespectfully hassle the official to leave them alone, Dani makes them pay at gunpoint. Here the impoverished Dani has the chance to take all of the contents of the man's wallet, which contains much more than the $7 fee, but he takes only the fee amount and tells them to beat it. Shortly after, a thug is hassling a street trinket-seller for ""taxes"" and threatens to take his goods. Danila swiftly knocks the thug out and makes friends with the man named Nemets, a homeless German. When his nationality comes up later, Danila says he has no problems with Germans, only Americans and Jews (Westerners). Nemets remains Danila's kindest friend throughout, and moral anchor, constantly supplying the wisdom of the film. Ironically, the most foolish character is the Russian Mob boss, who speaks in rhyming proverbs, but is driven by greed and power. Another disillusionment comes in the form of a brief love interest named Sveta, whose husband is an abusive drunk. This failing family mirrors the situation all over the city, as Nemets so sagely says, ""The city is an evil force. The strong come and become feeble. The city takes the strength away. And now you've fallen."" Even Dani's bitter old landlord speaks to everyone threateningly as though it is still WWII unless he is intoxicated. Nemets' words weigh heavily on Danila. In the climax moment when his brother (unbeknownst to Dani) has him cover his position in a heist suspected to be a trap, some innocent people get mixed up in the hit, one of them being the frontman of his favorite band. Danila makes a promise to save an innocent and turns on the two mob thugs when they finish their hit and start killing the witnesses.Danila has come to a realisation that his life is becoming the very substance he is fighting against, but that is not the end of his criminal lifestyle. The mob learns of this and take his brother in for beating and questioning. Then they discover Danila's address and rape and beat Sveta while he is away. Dani gets prepared to liberate the community of the mob and rescue his brother simultaneously. As he is made known to the front guard, in an act of mercy he gives him his word to spare his life if he remains quiet, which he follows up with after killing the rest of the gangsters. As Danila makes amends with the ultimate betrayal (his brother's) he takes the mob money and seeks to say goodbye to each of his acquaintances, to which he offers the only reparation he knows--money. Sveta has lost interest and seeks to reunite with her estranged husband, Kat passively accepts Dani's farewell and cash and Nemet follows up with his words of wisdom once more, ""what's good for the Russian is death for the German,"" a message contrary to his earlier mantra.Brother was Russia's big contemporary crime thriller. But besides being a low-budget blockbuster, it carries an important story of the resurfacing of morals in a fallen world, serving as a message for its Russian audience. The film ends with Danila hitching a ride to Moscow in a red (Russian) truck amidst the white backdrop of a road and forest blanketed with snow, symbolising the new beginning for Russia.",7,25 November 2014," Allegorical THawing Russian Success

/title/tt0118767/,"This movie is much inferior to its sequel Brother 2, and some other masterpieces of Balabanov, like the bleakly realistic Cargo 200 . That it is a no budget film is not a problem, many Eastern European movies are and are far superior. This is a commercial hit, and it is a Russian version of a Hollywood movie. Decent acting, but ultimately boring and lacking on artistic front, it is nevertheless improvement compared to the similar Russian cinema of the day, worth mostly for its realistic portrayal of the Russian decadence in the 90s and beyond.
The movie is tailored as populist take pandering to its Russian public. Brother 2 is more nationalistic but also much more artistically accomplished. This move was meant to earn money and it did, so Balabanov used it to make his arthouse masterpiece ""Of freaks and men"" that has much more to say about a true state of ""Russian soul"" than this one. All foreigners are portrayed in bad light. The murderous cute boy Danila (actor died in an avalanche, fittingly, a few years later, ushering him into legend in the eyes of vull gar Russian public) goes on to search for his identity by dating corrupt married women and druggies an accurate portrayal of womanhood in Russia to this day.The mobsters are all realistic, common Russian folk, who practice rr ape (that they became famous for during WWII, so much so that Yugoslav leader Djilas had to scorn Stalin for that, while Stalin defended the ""poor soldier lover boys"" and approved the rr apes as normal, thinking nothing about the innocent victims, he tried and often managed to enn slave. Fittingly, being kicked out of proud Yugoslavia and when trying to off leader Tito, getting an apt and bad ass message from fellow autocrat, much more sophisticated than the Georgian proudest son - ""We caught 7 people trying to kill me. If you don't stop sending them, I will have to send one myself. There will be no need to send another."" ). Movie deals ample doses of adult terry, murder, petty mob and Russian version of western hubris and hypocrisy, that is here documented at its most wounded, washed in copious amounts of vodka.Having been to Russia at its deepest point of ruin, at the time this movie was made, I can attest to its realism. The unclean fly markets at every metro station, immorality, adoration for worst of western ""culture"" or dismissing it with unearned hubris, all ring very real. President Putin got Russia out of this mud, and it is no surprise that he is ever so popular. Despite it being essentially a populist commercial Russian potboiler pandering and complimenting the worst instincts of this sometimes great, but often self absorbed nation, it is worth a watch if only to understand how decline and decadence look like up close. Russians might tap themselves over their thick shoulders telling that it is movie speaking only to themselves, but this movie is in fact very successful not only in over the top pandering managing to earn director enough money to move to more serious projects (luckily for everyone), but also for revealing, beneath the nationalistic facade, the true face of well deserved decline after decades of Russian imperial lism in the cloak of being the main bearer of socialist idea that they almost ruined - a fate that awaits the Amuricans too, as the Soviets were as conceited as they are before hitting the rock bottom during the well deserved but awakening Yeltsin years",5,13 August 2018," Potboiler and dissapointing

/title/tt0118767/,One thing that some other reviewers failed to comment on is the way that you discover just who Danila is - he covers-up the fact that he saw action in Chechnya and always says he served far from combat.  This story is really about the Russian crime situation LESS than about an entire generation of people who served in Afghanistan and Chechnya ('94-'96 and '99-present). This movie will be misunderstood by many Westerners (I am Russian myself) because it does not fit the traditional Hollywood screenplay style - and its characters do not behave themselves like most Hollywood characters would in a crime drama.  There is a very Slavic quality in this film that I am VERY happy to see preserved and NOT Westernized.  (You must see Brat2 to learn more about Brat.),,4 January 2001," More than a crime drama...

/title/tt0118767/,"This film is a reflection of the era after the collapse of the USSR.In fact, a simple Russian guy went through the first Chechen war, which destroyed him as a person. This war is unparalleled in the West by the level of cynicism and cruelty from his own commanders and leadership. People were left to die in dozens and hundreds by deception. This is Danila's great pain and the key thread of inner pain that goes with him through the entire film.It's not for nothing that he hides his active participation (which he won't reveal until the second film).He is angry at the whole world. Having been betrayed in this war, he tries to come back and expects nothing good from anyone. And when he returns he sees 1997 Russia with the highest level of crime possible. And he accepts this ""peacetime"" reality and just tries to survive.In doing so, the film tries to teach at least some mercy to the near and innocent people.This film really changed the former Soviet Union.

/title/tt0118767/,"This film was a blockbuster hit in Russia, for many reasons that international viewers might not understand.  ""Brother"" is a film that speaks directly to Russians (especially the urban population) about the time period directly following the fall of the Soviet Union.  This was a lawless time, full of uncertainty about everything including whether your life would be ended by a random criminal on the street.  It also suggests the Russian disillusionment with the Chechen War (well, the first one of the 1990s).Balabanov has created an intense crime drama that attempts to answer Dostoyevsky's ""eternal question"": what does one do in a lawless society? Danila, the hero, has lost his innocence during the war in Chechnya.  In this way he really represents all of Russia in that he has lost his heritage and his identity, and now must make his way in the new Russia.  Like many others at the time, Danila turns to crime in order to survive.The most heart-wrenching thing about ""Brother"" is that it has an incredible likeness to the reality of life in St. Petersburg in the early 1990s. Though on the surface it seems to be full of senseless violence, Danila's search for identity (that mirrors Russia's) calls for an honest picture of the hard life of the period.",,26 April 2004," Violent, but necessarily so

/title/tt0118767/,"""Brother"" managed to do many things to me through my first viewing. It confused me thoroughly, but through a little studying, and also through some reviews here on this site and others, it all became rather clear.This film comments on much of Russian culture, and being American, it can be hard to swallow without a background. The recent conflicts that so many Russian conscripts had joined, and had come back from, the state of the city Danila visits, the crime, the broken families, the Russian youth he meets that symbolize a sort of separated youth, and even his general attitude throughout the film. He acts nothing like any lead I've seen, often seeming aloof or distracted, and then seems to fall back on his military ways. The running joke of the film, from the very beginning, is that he is ""just a clerk"". It is very obvious that he is NOT.The film says much about Russian culture, and I won't bore anyone with technical details about direction or editing, as I know nothing about it, but as a film, as a dynamic, it works incredibly well.",8,24 January 2012," A true Russian culture film

/title/tt0118767/,"In the movie Brother, the hero, Danila, has two different sides to his personality: his creative, peaceful inner life that comes with his music versus his desire to get more powerful, making more money by killing, and climbing the ladder of success with rapid steps. Danila loves music very much. Music is like a gateway to his inner peaceful life. He buys new CDs and keeps listening them on his compact disc player when is strolling around the streets of St. Petersburg. We listen to the songs that he listens to, and we can sometimes understand the mood of the moment. Also Danila does not act selfish when he gets money in his hands, even though he worked hard to earn it by risking his life and killing people. However he is not selfish and shares the money he gets with his friends, and especially the two women in the movie Sveta and Kat is concerned he does not hesitate to share his money with them. He wants Sveta to enjoy his music hoping that she would be able to share his inner life. He buys a VCR and together with Sveta they watch some music clips.Throughout the movie Danila gets richer and more comfortable with the city. He keeps buying more CDs to listen to, and we see him walking around the city more and more. One time while he was listening to music and strolling, a man comes out from the corner and shoots Danila, at the same time Danila shoots him. Both of them get hit, the assassin dies, but Danila was hit on compact disc player which breaks down, but Danila is unharmed. This is actually an important event in the movie. The breaking of the compact disc player would mean that Danila would no longer be able to listen to music. Yet for one last time the music literally protects him. Further more, he would not be able to get in touch with his inner life, and he does not get another compact disc player. Also, from another point of view, this event could be considered as the end of Danila's peaceful inner life. It could be interpreted that the city has weakened him, and took away some part of him, although he might be still powerful with a shotgun, and with his skills. He thinks there is more action, more money and more power in Moscow, so he is going there.",,11 May 2004," Music saves Danila more than once.

/title/tt0118767/,"If you were in S.Petersburgh in the early nineties, you feel this movie has been able to grab a cubic meter of air of the city at that time, pack it, and give it to its viewers to breathe. The effect is physical. I can feel the smell of the wet dusty roads, the moulded no man's land of stairways in post soviet blocks of flats and much more. Apart from this high accuracy in physical sensation, the movie is multi-layered (you can watch in it a ""boevik"" action movie, a social analysis of the period, even a Dostoevki-like study on the value of brotherhood and after all, a unique picture of what Russia is, was, and will be.

/title/tt0118767/,"SPOILERS COMING
Also, the text is fairly long and is written as a guide for those who wish to understand the philosophy and subtext behind the film.This movie is a masterpiece. Yes, that straightforward. This status, which, mind you, is never given lightly, stems not from the overall presentation, cinematography, soundtrack, acting or even writing. It's a combination of these aspect, how well they are combined to create not only the most truthful depiction of 'devianostye', one of the darkest times in our history some might argue, but an admirable philosophical depth as well. The downside is: this context is so local in nature, that most of the foreign viewers might not even comprehend the movie to it's fullest, passing it on as just another criminal flick. You have to be familiar culturally, to know the historical context, and most of all, live through these times. My review is an attempt to convey the context to a foreign viewer, so be welcome.
The movie takes place in 1997, in the peak of the 90's. I was born only a year later. So today I sat with my little brother, being ready to pass my knowledge on to him and expose him to the times I was raised in, traces of them nearly erased in modern youth's consciousness. These were dark times: our once mighty country was destroyed, taken apart by bureaucrats, liars and thieves. The economy was in shambles: my brother was actually amazed to see that once our currency was so dirt cheap stuff cost millions. The exchange rates were dropping every day: you couldn't visit a shop without subsequent realization that through these 10 minutes you took your train your belongings already cost nothing and you couldn't by a block of bread with your fresh salary. If you were not robbed on the way there that is. And this is not an exaggeration. People did not know which government they were under. Now, the country was open for everything west: through the last decade of the Union western clothes and culture crept in, but with them poverty, drug trafficking, new forms of organized crime, but most of all - greed. It's no wonder, that people rapidly changed. People wanted to blame everyone for their misfortunes: their government (and rightfully so), jews, communists, bad luck. Nationalism raised like never before: if the Soviet Union was a brotherhood of nationalities, with cosmopolitan official ideology, the New Russia was born in hatred towards each other. Russians, Uzbeks, Chechens, Ukrainians were no longer brothers, no longer a totality that were the 'Soviet People'. This change is actually portrayed many times through the movie (""You're not my brother, you blackass scumbag!""). It was a deliberate choice I believe to call many characters by they're nationalities (like the Chechen). Also, criminality rose to incredible heights. A personal example: one night my father was awakened by the sound of his car's alarm. He approached the window just to see it taken apart for scrap right there, on the street.
Our hero, Danila, seems different though. Like a blank slate. Innocent. A bit foolish. Kind. Somewhat lonesome. A perfect Slav. He seems too young. But he is not as innocent as it seems. War has changed him. And spoiled him. Made him strong and stoic, but also taught him how to kill. And kill professionally. At the time, there were a lot of youth returning from the Chechen war. These people were teached to destroy from their teens. Now that was the only thing they new, their only education. What could they do with their broken lives back home? It's no bummer that most of them funneled from army into gangs.
Danila returns to the changed country somewhat alien. The people are different now. He seeks better life and heads to Leningrad to find his older brother. It's a brilliant choice to show us his brother's photo's beforehand: a kind feller, a former soldier no less. Now he is a contract killer. He informs his brother right away that the city is called Saint Petersburg now, reinforcing the theme that the country is entirely different now. He thinks Danila came for money, and he gives him a lot. But Victor completely misses the point that his brother's coming might have been sentimental. More than that: thinking his brother a noddy, he outward lies to him, positions himself as a 'businessman' (a new, popular word then), and tries to use him. Only in the ending we see that the tale is a classic one: the fool was wiser all along, and he saw it all coming. 
Danila is also reluctant, on many occasions, to reveal the details of his military service, just telling tales of doing paperwork in the headquarters. This is not true though, which is obvious because of his skills and craftiness. The thing is: Danila is not fond of killing. And he takes no pride for what he had to do. This immediately separates him from other criminals.
From there, Danila embraces his brother's manipulations. He does not really care. He is just determined to be there for his brother. Even when Victor betrays him, Danila comes with understanding. He saves his brother, he hugs him and calms him down. Although he reminds Victor of their childhood and how Victor was like a father to him, the brilliant positioning in the shot tells us that the real fatherly figure is now Danila. Because when others lost themselves, he retained. The tables have changed, a beautiful execution of a crucial plot point done entirely through positioning and beautiful acting. 
Gofman tells the hero earlier that 'cities are powerful'. Danila confronts him in the ending; 'You told me that the power is in the big cities, but the people here are weak. How so?' Gofman expands his point: 'Cities are powerful, but malignantly so. Strong people now flow into big towns. Cities deprive them of their strength. And you have succumbed too' The message of the movie now comes a full circle. The image of crying, rustling Victor is clear now. Remember the photos. Victor was a strong man once. As a teenager he was man enough to raise his brother on his own. He went through military. Then, he came here. He gave in to murder, gave in to greed. Now Victor is a lost, broken man, nothing compared to his brother, who somehow retained his qualities that Victor himself raised in him decades ago. Then, his girlfriend bitterly dumps him after shooting her abusive husband. Danila seems really confused. He tells her he has a lot of money and offers her to leave with him, but she declines. This picture, and Gofman's final speech make Danila how little money really means in the world of humanity. For all his money, Victor couldn't buy happiness. It's excess only made him morally pathetic. And now a new message, which will be fully explored in the sequel, is born in Danila's mind: the legendary words ""the Power is in Truth"". 
One of the final images in the movie is most brilliant I think. Danila and his punk-girl friend sit together at McDonalds, still a new curiosity at the time. He tells her he just wanted to say goodbye. The stupid girl does not understand. With no empathy she lightly says 'well, bye then'. Danila seems sad now. She offers him to hit some acid. He seems yet sadder. And full of pity. He finally asks 'what are you planning', clearly inquiring about her future. She exhales. ""I don't know, maybe go to an Observatory, perhaps to a concert, whatever. These are expensive now you know"". Danila is disappointed by the girl's inane replies. ""If this is our youth, our country is f*cked"" he probably thinks. Finally, he is prepared to take off. He gives her a lot of money. The girl could not even comprehend such generousity and questions it a couple of times. For Danila though, money means nothing now. These two characters are shown now as polar opposite to the fullest. Finally, Danila looks out of the window, with the McDonalds sign on it. This image is imprinted in mi mind forever, pinnacle of the movie's message. This is what Russia has become. Regress of values. Drugs. Violence. Hatred. Individuality as repulsion of collectivity. And the symbol of this change? American junk food. 
Of course, this review does not target americans, just as the movie doesn't. The issue, you see, is destruction of once mighty ideology, which aimed for comradery, labor, kindness and empathy. With ideology went away our identity. The main message of the movie is how identity of the whole nation was replaced simultaneously with the worst west could have offered. Instead of beautiful western ideals and culture, namely literature, people preferred consumerism, greed, casual sex and unsophisticated lifestile. Because money can buy you a new television, an expensive car like in the western movies, attract women. The thing is: it will not buy your humanity back. Nor will it return the bright future we, that is all the nationals of the soviet republics, might have had as a socialist nation.
Another issue that the director Alexey Balabanov brings up is the change from collective-oriented way of life to individual responsibility. Most people at the time did not know what to do with it the newly acquired possibilities (and responsibilities), and got mugged by more industrious and immoral people as a result. It was, and still is, needed to find a compass, something dependable in this new environment. Balabanov saw it in traditional institutions, namely family. Blood is thick.
Amongst it all, Danila stands as the perfect Slavic hero. Obviously, Danila represents our nation at the time, a true timestamp, a monument to Russian mentality. Ultimately kind and, to some extent, heroic, even if violent and nationalistic, he has to find his own path in the changed world, one of righteousness and truth. And just like him, through all the obstacles, through mud, decay and blood, Russia had to find her way to new beginnings.

/title/tt0118767/,"This movie is much inferior to its sequel Brother 2, and some other masterpieces of Balabanov, like the bleakly realistic Cargo 200 . That it is a no budget film is not a problem, many Eastern European movies are and are far superior. This is a commercial hit, and it is a Russian version of a Hollywood movie. Decent acting, but ultimately boring and lacking on artistic front, it is nevertheless improvement compared to the similar Russian cinema of the day, worth mostly for its realistic portrayal of the Russian decadence in the 90s and beyond. The movie is tailored as populist take pandering to its Russian public. Brother 2 is more nationalistic but also much more artistically accomplished. This move was meant to earn money and it did, so Balabanov used it to make his arthouse masterpiece ""Of freaks and men"" that has much more to say about a state of illness of ""Russian soul"" than this one. Jews and Polish people, as all foreigners, are portrayed in full of hate colors. The murderous cute boy Danila (actor died in an avalanche, fittingly, a few years later, ushering him into legend in the eyes of not so sophisticated Russian public) goes on to search for his identity by dating corrupt married women and druggies, an accurate portrayal of womanhood in Russia to this day. The mobsters are all realistic, common Russian folk, who practice forced love making also known by a censored word starting with r and ending with e (that they became famous for during WWII, so much so that Yugoslav leader Djilas had to scorn Stalin for that, while Stalin defended the ""poor soldiers"" and approved the forced making of moskal babies as normal, thinking nothing about the innocent victims, he tried and often managed to enslave. Fittingly, being kicked out of proud Yugoslavia and when trying to off leader Tito, getting an apt and bad ass message from fellow autocrat, much more sophisticated than the Georgian son - ""We caught 7 people trying to kill me. If you don't stop sending them, I will have to send one myself. There will be no need to send another."" ). Movie deals ample doses of adult ery, murder, thu g gery, and Russian version of western arrogg gance and hypocrisy, that is here documented at its most wounded, washed in copious amounts of vodka.Having been to Russia at its deepest point of ruin, at the time this movie was made, I can attest to its realism. The dirty fly markets at every metro station, immorality, adoration for worst of western so called pop culture or dismissing it with unearned arrog ggance, all ring very real. President Putin got Russia out of this mud, and it is no surprise that he is ever so popular. Despite it being essentially a populist commercial Russian tree sh pandering and complimenting the worst instincts of this sometimes great, but often self absorbed nation, it is worth a watch if only to understand how decline and decadence look like up close. Russians might tap themselves over their thick shoulders telling that it is movie speaking only to themselves, but this movie is in fact very successful not only in over the top pandering managing to earn director enough money to move to more serious projects (luckily for everyone), but also for revealing, beneath the nationalistic facade, the true face of well deserved decline after decades of russian imperialism in the cloak of being the main bearer of socialist idea that they almost ruined - a fate that awaits the amuricans too, as the soviets were as arrog glant as they are before hitting the rock bottom during the well deserved but awakening Yeltsin years.",3,13 August 2018," shabby and comerical

/title/tt0118767/,"""Brother"" is a movie considered iconic with its main character who became a national hero in Russia. In fact, watching this movie dispels any doubts that it is a great film. 
One of the astonishing phenomenon of this movie is that the main idea is so artfully hidden, so the most of viewers who adore this film don't get it right (it demonstrates the great skill of the director).
The main character, Danila Bagrov, who has a name of the Bible prophet, came to Sankt-Petersburg. Sankt-Petersburg was the ""criminal capital of Russia"" in 1990s, its inhabitants had got bogged down in violence and venality (like the ""sin city of Babylon""). Danila exposed some ""bad people"" to retribution, thereby delivered justice and at the same time unselfishly helped some ""good people"". At the first glance the main idea and a positive image of the main character are obvious (it's shared by the most viewers).
But what did Danila leave behind him besides killed people, broken destinies and confusion in people's hearts on the scorched earth? What mission did he have and what about did he prophesize? That is the question..
Surely, the murders which he committed were caused forcibly, not by his bloodthirstiness, although during the film it becomes obvious that Danila undergoing challenges of ""sin city"" reveals himself as a part of this system; He was dragged into the same sins, playing according to rules of violence by the same means: cunning and force, with the only difference - his weapon managed to overtake his enemies faster than they could overtake him.
The main point here that in such a war there are no people who are right, and a fighter against the evil is not necessarily for good. Danila reflects the vices of reality around him - he doesn't like Jews, Caucasians, Americans (by the way, his name is originated from Hebrew but likely he doesn't think about it). He is produced by that age and doesn't have any reference points or purposes. Danila defines power by the violence (""the strength is in the truth"" will come later, in the ideologically opposite sequel). His power is destructive, not constructive. For Sveta (a woman who he likes), acquaintance with Danila ends up as tragedy. Her even more hopeless life isn't his fault because it's provided with her inner brokenness, and not without reason she drives a tram which as we all know can't roll of the rails. At the end of the film German Gofman pass a verdict to Danila: ""a city is a evil power, a strong man comes and becomes weak here, so you too"". By the way, Gofman here is an obvious arguer (i.e. a character who tells the author's opinion), he distanced himself from the ""sin city"" as he is a homeless marginal living among the dead (in a cemetery), that let him keep his purity in the middle of human dirt. 
No wonder that all Danila's actions are only his reaction to circumstances around and they are not caused by his own purpose and impulse. Danila himself can't get an answer to the question he asked to the German, ""why do we live?""...
Dmitry Bykov (a famous Russian writer) noticed recently that Danila Bagrov is a symbol of the emptiness. During the film we often can see a ""transparent"" tram which demonstrate Danila's emptiness. But a ""transparent"" tram is a symbol of not only of him but also an emptiness of the age of timelessness in which all of Russian people has ended up. Perhaps, this is the main thing here: acute pain for country with its unfulfilled expectations, torn by the beasts in these ""stone jungles"", the absence of any sense in what is happening around and the heavy, oppressive uncertainty of its future ... ""Russia, where are you riding? Give an answer. It doesn't give an answer. """,10,23 September 2018," A movie about uncertainty of Russia's future..

/title/tt0118767/,"Danila is a prime example of a young Russian who has been tainted by war; but he also represents hope for post-Soviet Russia. In many reviews he is described as a 'cold blooded killer' and as 'showing no remorse'- which is sometimes true, however he is so honest and good at the same time. He never once in the movie betrays a promise, and he helps anyone in trouble that crosses his path. Although he seems to find it easy shooting and killing other mafia killers, he puts himself in the 'hero' role on the streets: protecting innocent people from harm such as the German and the ticket collector on the bus.His taste in music reflects aspects of his personality- his disdain for American and European dance music mirrors his views on these countries, and how the army has built in an unnecessary, unreasonable bitterness for certain types of people (i.e. Jews)into his mind, without him really understanding why he feels this way. He says 'whats the difference?' when referring to Jews and Germans, and Americans and French people- showing his lack of real experience with people of these nations, and thus his ignorance.His relationship with the battered wife, I think, represents his need to do good, perhaps out of guilt for all the wrong he has done. The casting of her as a blatantly unattractive woman who is much older than Danila and who's character has absolutely nothing in common with him is important: in front of him is not a woman he is in love with, but someone who is in dire need of a hero, and of something positive in her life. Thus he does his best to make her happy, only failing (in my view) because the relationship is not real- the passion isn't really there.Unlike most people, i enjoyed Brother more than the sequel to it- it is understated, but says a lot about society and about relationships. There is so much to say about it, yet so little time!",8,1 May 2007," Brother review
