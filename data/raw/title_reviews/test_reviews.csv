/title/tt13433812/,The best part is watching the boyish faced SJK in elegant suits do mafia like things in Korea. I just want to laugh whenever he does his thing. The classical music and opera is well used. The end of each episode is funny and something outrageous usually happens to get you to tune in to the next episode. The first episode was strong with the contrast between how he deals with bad guys in Italy and Korea. Timely nod to Purdue Pharma narcotic issues in episode 3. Episode 4 is quite grand and past things come together.The bad part is subsequently the humour is often painful and the unnecessary overacting of Jeon Yeo Bin is hard to watch. Ok Taecyeon is almost unrecognisable as the goofy intern but his hairstyle changes as he does. Excellent supporting actor Kwak Dong Yeon is a memorable here as a bad guy.I'm still hoping the series will get better and things will get funnier and less painful. They try for jokes when it isn't necessary and it often fails. Even Itaewon Class was funnier and it wasn't mainly a comedy because they reserved jokes for when it counted. Culture clash has the potential for much laughter but it isn't well used. The reactions of the actors are too exaggerated. So many scenes could have been cut.,7,1 March 2021," SJK is priceless but the comedy is somewhat off

/title/tt13433812/,"Korean Drama "" Vincenzo "" had a good concept but there were times that it didn't make it work.The main problem with this drama is the length. It's not only twenty episodes long, each episode also was about an hour and twenty minutes. However, the story was not for that length. Therefore, there were episodes, especially the final ones, when the story was full of fillers, unnecessary twists, and ridiculous situations that were trying too hard to be funny. The blend, though, of action, comedy, and legal themes was an interesting combination that worked for most of the cases. Most of the characters were also pretty interesting, though some of them, like the piano lady and the female lead, were annoying and it was obvious that they were written to be eccentric, but that was presented in a way that screamed try-hard. The villain was a boring character in the second half of the drama. However, it must be noted that the big twist was an innovative one and pretty entertaining.As for the performances, everyone did a great job, especially the male lead who finally found the right character for his proper comeback after the big hit DOTS.So, overall, six out of ten.",6,30 June 2021," Good Enough

/title/tt13433812/,"Honestly, I sort of enjoyed the early episodes that melded violent crime with slapstick. But it morphed into slapstick and soap opera. Over the top acting, plot and generally silly, cringeworthy scenes.A meandering mess that forced me to stop after 7 episodes. I checked to see if I was near the end and was horrified to see how many more we due to follow. A horror show.Oh, and once an episode our handsome hero throws his lighter away with dramatic effect to burn some major plot location down. Within five minutes we see him annoyingly flicking his trusty lighter that must have magical powers to resist in his hand. OMFG. 🙄",3,26 October 2021," CRINGENZO

/title/tt13433812/,"Review By Kamal KAlthough the episodes are longer than normal Kdramas and one episode is 80+ mins, but the story was pretty comprehensive! Not draggy and fast paced, especially in the second half!It all presented in a dark comedy kind of series, with a righteous leader, great amount of fighting scenes, a storyline of corruption and some witty yet hilarious plot throughout. I really enjoyed all of these because it just had all the humour, emotional and thrill in a show, really exciting and fun to watch! This drama in some ways, blows my mind with the integration of mafia and allows all the killing and gun shooting. Well honestly it's kinda weird if you were to think how the male lead can ""lawfully"" kill and torture so many people, but in other way of thinking, these were the best parts of the show!! I don't know about the others, but I just find all the parts where the king of evil are dealing with the demons were so satisfying to watch! So, I just chose to savor it, don't care if it makes any sense, as long as it entertains!Applaud to all the casts, they were all equivalently goooood! Song Joong Ki literally slayed the role and was really cool in all his fighting scenes! Not to say, it really gave me a great laugh whenever he was being ""harassed"" by numerous guys hahaha! Literally everyone in the show is treating him like a meat on the plate! XD Taecyeon was pretty good too, although I personally find him not so suitable for the role, his face just looks too kind for the role, doesn't look bad and scary at all, the starting part of him being a dumb innocent rookie suits him much better! But it was a great spinoff in his acting career, good for him! :) Dongyeon, as good as always, he always pulls off all kinds of characters, a cool one, a psycho or even a coward but kind-hearted little brother. Gosh, and why do his roles always make people wanna protect him so much?Well, I would say maybe not all might enjoy this, but generally, YES! This doesn't have much love story (almost none?), it's more about a deep end conspiracy with a group of people led by a mafia lawyer to fight crime and save the day!!! So if you are looking for a good story, this is it!",9,28 September 2021," Pure Entertainment

/title/tt13433812/,"The stylish visuals and rather interesting premise made me hope for something different, but in the end, ""Vincenzo"" is just one more cheesy Korean drama with soap opera level writing and cringeworthy humor. It could have worked as a ""so bad it's good"" show, but episodes are too long and possibly slower than arthouse cinema, with the same gags repeated all over again, embarrassing product placement, and endless slow-motion shots with people walking along hallways to show off or do funny faces. The humor rests mainly on the contrast between the dark tone of the main story and the goofiness of the support characters, but the jokes are corny and the performances are utterly annoying.The protagonist is a Korean-born, Italian-raised mafia lawyer who is back in his motherland to deal with unfinished business. Yet there is nothing Italian about him - he just slurs random Italian sayings and listens to opera while drinking red wine (come on!!). He is supposed to be a cold-blooded mafia consigliere, yet they spend half of the series trying to justify his extreme actions as if he was a hero forced to fall to the same level as his enemies. The sparse moments of action are extremely dull and formulaic, but I have to admit that there are also a few absolutely crazy but undeniably original plot resolutions every now and then.",3,24 August 2021," Atrocious

/title/tt13433812/,"I thought the first half was uneven and could be substantially cut, making a 16 ep series. I thought the second half was as good as any fine Korean series-meaning superb. I stayed with it because of the fabulous cast-terrific on all levels-and was rewarded. The ending was satisfying even if graphic, but hey, don't mess with a mobster's mom, you twits. I loved the sweet pigeon bromance and pigeon onslaught, and the masterful reverse image of the raven. That was revoltingly satisfying as well. And yes there is even romance and a great kiss, too.

/title/tt13433812/,"A feel good mafia comedy is hard to come by. Let alone a Korean one.To feel good the good guys had to win. All the time. But such is not the case here. There are lots of death here. Very calculated. And many fight scenes. Together with a fairly sizeable support cast. And most are really one dimensional. Only the 3-4 are somewhat fully fleshed out.The evil ones are really evil. The slimy one stays slimy. The comedy sidekicks also. No one changed a bit except the female lead.And there are loads of side stories.

/title/tt13433812/,I thought it would be difficult for Joongki to have another love team after the divorce but interestingly the netizen liked the girl. She is not as pretty as the other female leads before but she is funny and had a strong character. Her acting is not annoying either so I guess the netizens fell for this girl too. I like the plot of how each villain ended. I was shocked of how Vincenzo's character was really dark but I guess it will not make sense if it is not related to Mafia. The supporting characters had each unique contributing roles that came as a surprise. Overall I really liked this kdrama but it I think Joongki's acting can still be improved. I also wished that he avenged himself on the two robbers who stole his watch in the first episode.,9,15 July 2021," Song Joongki at his finest look

/title/tt13433812/,"You can see the cast had a lot of fun making this Italian/Korean would-be mafia thriller, the sort of fun NOT experienced in Hollywood since the days of Burt Reynolds. Vincenzo contains a very absorbing plot, a cast star-struck by designer clothes, interspersed with Italian (and other) Classical music excerpts to set in relief some well written suspense and intrigue. The plot centers on, if we really are to believe it, the endemically CORRUPT upper echelons of S. Korean society. Is it a coincidence that many of the systemic abuses of power and institutional vice that constitute Vincenzo's Main Plot are now also going on, this very moment in the USA? It is certainly food for thought. A clear advantage this Korean drama has over mediocre US shows, however is a much softer-handed use of violence, resorting more often to satire to keep the plot moving as opposed to gratuitous savagery now so common in so-called ""hit"" US shows. So far, so good, Binjenzo!",8,9 March 2021," Best Korean Series so far!

/title/tt13433812/,"The premise of Vincenzo immediately sparks interest: a Korean born yet Italian naturalized lawyer is a very stylish and cold consiglieri to an Italian maffia family. Through some criminal circumstances he finds himself back in South Korea looking to seize on a (literally) golden opportunity. He camps out in a building that is to be demolished and is surrounded by its weird and wonderful tenants, facing a choice: do I support these lower class citizens or do I take a more opportune road?What follows are a few very funny episodes that establish the many colorful characters and leave you grasping for answers. After what I can only describe as a very cool build up, in episodes three and four those questions get answered in ways that will surprise even the most knowledgeable viewers. By that time I was invested in the excellently written personas and the developments really hit home.Since it is a Korean series, the differences between the poor and the corrupt rich elite are once again highlighted (a common theme in the often excellent Korean cinema), but with a few great twists. The series has a quirky sense of humor and balances nicely between shocking real world maffia problems and fun. It uses Italian music tropes found in your average Hollywood maffia film in a Korean setting, which works out brilliantly.The stylish star of the show is both likeable and pretty scary at the same time while he's being tested in ways he did not even encounter during his time in the Italian maffia. It's a surprisingly fun ride, fantastically filmed and edited, has great use of music and had me thinking 'oh, hell yes' on several occasions.Sometimes it takes a monster to defeat other monsters.

Fantastic cast and script, this is another Studio Dragon slick production with wonderful visuals and soundtrack, thrilling fight sequences and generally, a real and powerful gripping and emotional journey. I could not stop watching once I'd started!! I really loved the cast and the leads are wonderful together!! Real magic between Song Jong-Ki and Jeon Yeon Bin. Wow!!! Thrilling to watch, from start to finish! Loved it!!",10,10 June 2021," Thrilling from start to finish

/title/tt13433812/,"Ughhh. Gotta comment on 19th eps. 19th ending was very upset! When chairman brother attack his brother, In real life, it's the clear and the best option that other man at the risk should attack him together at the same time for sake to steal the gun and cut the risk to get shot. But film writer turns it into too drama and was too upset and too bad for the movie! Writer should have changed this scenario into more reality.",9,29 June 2021," Ughhh

/title/tt13433812/,"The first couple episodes were just ok and also there were some good plot twist and many funny moments.But the people in the building he owned were so annoying and the female leads trying so much to be funny with silly gestures. The more I watched the worse it got. The main characters were as evil as the bad guys, and that's saying something.

/title/tt13433812/,"I binged watching this for only two days, which I don't think I'd do it for a K-drama, but this one is exceptional. I really love this drama, it is so good, funny and the main casts are so good looking. At first, I wasn't a fan of Song Joong-Ki, but it totally changed after watching him in this drama. His charisma is sooo on point as Vincenzo, and he really enchanted me with his magic. Surprisingly the soundtracks are also very well matched with every scene, even though most soundtracks are so classic with Italian vibes. And I also love Jeon Yeo-been and Kim Yeo-jin, they play the characters realllyyy reallyyyy well. Although the love scenes are very minimum in this drama, but I still really love it. I am so thrilled with the dark comedy offered in this drama.",9,26 August 2021," Best of Song Joong-ki, so far

/title/tt13433812/,"I have watched a lot of K-dramas, but this one is right at the top of the best of them. It is almost a satire of The Godfather--or the mafia genre. Each time Vincenzo pulls off a ""mafia-style retort"" to the opposition, we get a little Mozart to go along with it. Feels so right! Vincenzo occasionally says something in Italian that also sounds amazing.I never thought I would see a K-drama like this. It is totally different than most. It is very refreshing to see something original when too often TV shows are just carbon copies of other popular shows.Watching this show gives me a feeling of comfort and pleasure. I almost didn't watch it because it warned of ""crime, fear, smoking"" which didn't sound very good to me. I am glad I did watch it. I go along with some other reviewers who say you should watch a few episodes before you judge it.I can't wait for the next episode and I wish this drama would never end.",10,19 April 2021," This is top notch

/title/tt13433812/,"It was such a good series to have ended so open.After so many episodes, viewers would have liked to have some type of uplifting ending. So, this is my creation for a more ""fanciful"" ending.After leaving Korea, using the ""one year later"" time jump, Vincenzo - who has a wealth of information on corrupt dealings - has now been given some type of position with Interpol. He goes to the Korean-Italian conference and reunites with Hong Cha Young and they share that ""kiss moment"" under the stars and he leaves, only to return to Geumga Plaza and surprises all the quirky residents for some over the top sentimentality, with each resident having their own astonished encounter with Vincenzo. The Plaza and surrounding area is reborn so the city becomes revitalized thanks to the stash of gold that is being laundered and the funds are used just for that.Hong Cha Young and Vincenzo are married in the Buddhist Temple with the Plaza residents in attendance. They establish a law firm for those who have no political or social voice.In the revitalized building, Inzaghi the pigeon of karma returns to the window with...a family!I'm sure I missed a few other things, but I think viewers would have wanted that uplifting and well-done, tear-jerking finale.",10,9 July 2021," MY SENTIMENTAL ENDING

/title/tt13433812/,"Loved
1. One of the best anti-heroes (I've seen many)
2. Lots of social commentaries weaved into drama
3. Active interaction with the audience
4. Brilliant acting and direction with no unnecessary bloodshed
5. Lots of pop literature referencesQualms
1. Technical plot holes
2. PredictableVincenzo is our anti-hero who is devoted to family, reads books like how to befriend birds, and also takes revenge using the spear of atonement. He doesn't believe in serving justice, so he formulated a set of strict principles to avenge crime as a vigilante with calm precision.The show organically shifts between crime, comedy and romance so it feels quite realistic. The plot is- the fall of a psychopath, and how pain stacking difficult it is, thanks to the corrupt judicial system and government. I loved many pop culture references like the miserable ones, modern art and other classic super-rich mafia thrill. In terms of direction, the show is super engaging especially when it interacts with the audience by breaking the 4th wall and also empowering the average civilians within the show. There is no unnecessary bloodshed and nudity like the usual US made shows in this genre, and I appreciate that! The criminals, too get panic attacks like genuine humans :0The show is crime drama heavy so it fills you with adrenaline, but there are technical errors and plot holes. Still the overall script outshines those issues. And of course, to follow up for next seasons they made this one, highly predictable.Overall I loved this show. The social commentary, the drama, everything, kept me on the edge. It's an escapist fever dream from the real-life failures of our society.

/title/tt13433812/,"If the comedy isn't for you then fair enough. A comedy will never favour because not everyone has the same humour. However I personally think this show has a perfect balance of thriller, action, comedy and suspense. Those who judge shows after watching 1 episode I think are rather stupid. Obviously you're not gonna fully grasp the characters in episode 1/20...that's why there's more episodes. The acting is great, the characters are great, the cinematography is great, some parts you're not supposed to take seriously because they're for comedic purposes. I love the character development too it's amazing. I also love the storyline and the idea of a Korean - Italian mafia...it's quite interesting. I don't wanna give away too much but at least watch til ep 3-4 til you judge. It's definitely worth watching. I like how the romance between the two leads isn't super cliché and isn't the main focus either but it's still there, it's more of a slow burn romance between them. The action scenes are well shot and quite realistic too. Omg I could go on and on about this show I love it so much.

Koreans obsession with Europe and how they romantacise west in their shows is another topic for discussion which i wont get into.

/title/tt13433812/,I have watched more than 100 of kdramas so far and this one is epic. Ofcourse my favorite part was song joon ki but the plot was wonderful. The writers and directors have done a fantastic job with the other crew members. Every single actor/tress had done a wonderful job to bring this drama to us. You should definitely give this a try.

/title/tt13433812/,"The low reviews are perplexing. Makes you wonder about the people writing them - they must have an agenda. Its humor is what makes it a jewel. Never laughed out loud so much in any Korean show, and I've been watching them for many years. Moreover, people overlook its social value. It highlights how out of control corruption has gotten, and that a paradigm shift of attitude and approach will be necessary to fight the elite stranglehold on power that exists pretty much all over the world now. I think this goes over most people's heads, sadly. For most people, the series is just entertainment. For me, it's a strategy. Excellent cast and acting. I sure hope the brilliant team that did this show gives us more.",10,30 August 2021," The Best

/title/tt13433812/,"I get what People say about the show being to corny. It started of great, I was all in, even watching 2 episodes subsequently.He's a great character, being played very well. She was goofy and somewhat funny at first, but started to annoy me a bit after a while.There are a lot of good laughs, don't get me wrong. And the story was interesting. But it all just feels a bit too stretched sometimes, and some of the joking and banter aren't really that funny.The show seems to get more goofy and wacky as it continues.. Or maybe it's only now starting to bore me. Somewhere around episode 10-11 I began to watch only half an episode and later on the other half. Now I even stopped a couple of times after 20 minutes.

/title/tt13433812/,"Vincenzo popped up on my Netflix feed after finishing Kingdom, which in my opinion is one of the best zombie movie/series out there.Vincenzo starts off with a blast, pun intended, and stays pretty steady. However I can't give it a 10 for two reasons: the lead actress and drawing out the episodes.After I got over the initial sour taste of the kdrama formula, which seems to be an odd mix of slapstick comedy and overt violence, I stayed on board through all twenty movie-length episodes. Did you read that? Twenty movie-length episodes. The cat and mouse between Vicenzo and Han Seok was great at times but it became so exhausting that by episode 16 I was like just finish them already!!!!I'm in agreement with several other reviews, the female lead was a weak link. So much so, I fast forwarded over some of her scenes. She wasn't funny and her behavior was more immature/clownish for a lawyer. She only became palatable when she became more of a straight man towards the middle of the series.All in all this was a really good series. The acting was exceptional and the cat and mouse between Vincenzo and Han Seok kept me watching, albeit exhausted, till the end. And I'm even anticipating season 2, if there is one. The episodes just needed to be cut down/or out.",8,3 June 2021," Couple of bumps but pretty good

It respects the idea of evil because we are really are not always good or right, we are bad too, and the lesson ushered by the main character will stay with me for life .It is an intelligent series, it was only unbelievable once when pigeon saves Vincenzo but I like that too because I am a romantic, rest was a very well researched plot with good looking people.After you have watched it, either you will become Vincenzo or you will want a Vincenzo of your ownPS Vincenzo is beautiful.",10,16 August 2021," A protagonist with brain

/title/tt13433812/,"Vincenzo started slow with episodes 1 and 2, but by episode 4, the ride was incredibly fast that I was reluctant to call it a day after hours of bingeing over the weekend. It is incredible how a single series can manage to be within seconds funny, serious, suspenseful, thrilling, and towards the end, scary. Yet the quick shifts in tone and mood did not feel jarring or distracting. The plot twists and turns kept me at the edge of my seat.That Vincenzo, in the end, reverts to being the sadistic, violent, and scary member of the Mafia is strangely forgivable, because well... he is with the Mafia.What I liked:
1. Cast - Soong Joong-ki seemed to have been tailor fit for his role. Despite his smooth handsome-ness, he managed to be eerily merciless and soul-less when he had to. The rest of the ""Cassano family"" of Geumga Plaza were a riot.2. Storyline - the story is simple, and was carried more by the acting and script. I found myself laughing out loud by myself yet at times hiding behind pillows especially during the last episode. One moment I was laughing at the Guemga Cassano family, the next moment I could barely watch Vincenzo's torturing his enemies.3. Script - catchy, fast. If this were a book, I'd be speed-reading it, hardly able to wait for each chapter to get to the next. The funny parts were not comedic, exaggerated, nor slapstick. The sting operations were well-thought off. It reminded me so much of Ocean's 11, but this was Korean-style.4. Soundtrack - helped a lot in the shift of moods. Serious moments were broken by sudden changes in soundtrack mood. Choice of music was excellent.What made my ranking short of 10 are the few lapses and gaps in logic, but easy to let pass:
1. I can understand that the whole time, Han-seok and Vincenzo were playing cat and mouse and didn't want to kill each other for the thrill of it. But towards the end, after leaving prison, Han-seok wanted Vincenzo dead once and for all. Couldn't he have just gone to Vincenzo's small settlement unit that didn't even have a security lock, and just shot him dead? They could have at least shown a failed attempt at this.2. That thing about Inzaghi and a whole flock of pigeons saving Vincenzo' life.... I have very mixed feelings about this. If there was one thing I was not expecting to be built into the script, it was a minute of fantasy.I was satisfied with the ending. It wasn't open, yet a gap left for a (hopeful) season 2. Minor lapses notwithstanding, this is a show that brought me to one helluva ride. Will definitely watch again.",9,5 May 2021," Almost Perfect

/title/tt13433812/,"Some say that nothing about this drama is realistic. Others say that the hype is exaggerated. In my case, it is hand down the best drama I've seen. I'm amazed at the many details they put into this drama. The small facial ticks of Joon-Woo when he gets angry, the little smirk Vincenzo gives his foes when he's about to make his surprise move, and Cha-Young's little confidence boost when she's in a dangerous situation. My favourite scenes are those where Vincenzo breaks character, in which he feels uncomfortable. You clearly see our beloved consigliere fighting an internal battle, and thinking
about a way to end this circus show. But when he is about to make a move on his 'chessboard', there is no sign of that man.I have no bad words about this drama. It isn't your typical drama about romance and self-discovery in which most of time you can usually predict the outcome. No, it's filled with well-thoughted out unpredictable plots twists. Like the characters, you are filled with adrenaline and emotions. Sitting in the edge of the couch, you are literally screaming at your screen, applauding their victories and (maybe) crying when something bad happens.I recommend watching this drama!",10,23 May 2021," The best one so far!

/title/tt13433812/,"While it takes around 3-4 episodes, Vincenzo is undeniably an underrated series that gets overlooked due to the fact it's a K-drama. Although the medium has a reputation for having excessive amount of romance (from what I've heard), Vincenzo is nothing like that, the mild amount of romance does not affect the story in any way.The first 4 episodes are slightly predictable, the rest of the show is a Rollercoaster that will keep you on the edge of the seat.The main character of Vincenzo - Vincenzo Cassano is also really great. Well-written, charming and a straight up overpowered badass, he takes on multiple foes using his wit and experience as a mafia accompanied by a great cast of side characters who are equally as likeable.The show touches on the subject of human greed and Vincenzo must deliver Justice while at the same time tries to grow into a more humble person despite his past life.",9,16 September 2021," I'm glad this was one of my first K-drama

/title/tt13433812/,"I didn't expect much from this show at all. In fact I expected to not even finish the first episode. But boy I'm glad I did.This show surpassed my expectations in the very best way. The show is original and very well written and paced out. Song Joon-ki is awesome, amazing and sexy as hell as Vincenzo. He embodies the role whole heartedly. He makes you laugh, makes you cheer him on to kick ass and tugs on your heart strings. I was incredibly impressed with his skill and dedication to this role. The supporting cast are endearing and throughout the series you get to know a little bit about each one. There is surprisingly a lot of humor, which is honestly a relief because without it the show would be very dark. If I had one gripe it would be sometimes I thought the episodes where a tad long. But on the other hand, you just get to spend more time with Vincenzo and his ragtag group of friends so didn't mind it.This show is just flat out awesome. So much better that whatever Hollywood is peddling out. I hope there's a season two, this show totally deserves it!",10,2 October 2021," Wow wow wow.

/title/tt13433812/,"There is almost nothing about this show that I didn't love, from the slick James Bond-style title scene to the cherub-faced mobster dealing out vigilante justice with a badass lawyer by his side. I've seen some other reviews that didn't like the humour, so I just wanted to say that this style of wacky comedy is exactly my type - absurd, and not too serious! Sometimes dark comedies can get rather grotesque, and while Vincenzo doesn't shy away from gory scenes, gruesome injuries and death are never the subject of the jokes. Engaging characters, plenty of action and an excellent soundtrack make this all around a show that is well worth watching!",10,17 October 2021," Entertaining and exciting with goofy humour

/title/tt13433812/,"I cannot express how much I loved this drama. It has the perfect balance of everything - drama, tragedy, comedy, chemistry. It does not fall short on entertainment. The kind of series you cannot look away from. The main leads - Song Joon-ki and Jeon Yeo-been have done a phenomenal job as has the rest of the cast. The villains are villainy enough that you do not feel sorry for them even once. There is no trope of bad man having a soft spot for the female lead. No overt sexual tension but enough undercurrent to keep you hooked. No excessive sentimentality from anyone. The perfect balance!",10,23 May 2021," ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT

/title/tt13433812/,"How to best describe Vincenzo? On the surface it seems like the Godfather meets Korean drama and the premise looks promising. In practise, I can at best describe it as a strange mix of black comedy, mixed with action and horror elements. Truly a strange mix, which ends up being confusing and you end up on a rollercoaster, but one that is moving in all directions!The whole story did not make any sense and was far from credible and may be culturally insensitive. A Korean adoptee who can speak fluent Korean and Italian with a heavy Korean accent. Right...! The development of the characters was stale and the plot twists may be surprising, but totally ridiculous.The sub-plot where Vincenzo was gay baiting someone was truly offensive. In this time of inclusion, I found this highly cringe and insensitive. It may be normal for a Korean audience, but in the rest of the world this is not done.We see through the episodes the violence escalating. Where it starts relatively innocent, it escalates into something increasingly more gruesome and gore. Culminating in the torture and demise of the antagonists: stabbing in the neck where we see blood pouring out, live burning of a woman and the slowly drilling to death of the ""end boss"". It intends to shock and wrap up the story, but I found it unnecessary, unsatisfactory and out of context with the vibe of the other episodes.The acting of some characters was quite good though, notably the main protagonist Vincenzo (Song Joong-ki) and the antagonists Choi Myung-hee (Kim Yeo-jin), Jang Han-seo (Kwak Dong-yeon) and Jang Han-seok (Ok Taec-yeon). I can appreciate their performance. It is just that everything else was incoherent and a confusing mess.And what about the take home message of Vincenzo? There is no justice in this world. An eye for an eye. Torture and killing is okay. It is okay to take matters in your own hand. How can you spread such a message? Truly incredible!",4,16 May 2021," Confusing mess and overrated

/title/tt13433812/,"I have to say I started watching K-Dramas early this year. I randomly picked Stranger (Bimilui Soop) season one and when it finished I could hear a click inside my head. South Korean TV shows are in a golden era. Period. After that I've seen many- and I mean MANY - south-korean series. Some are good. Some are VERY good. Few are outstanding. Vincenzo is one of those. Some K-Dramas start very strong with a very good premise. The seasons are long - usually 18 episodes - wich I love as oppose to Netflix' 8 episode standard.Problem is, some of them start decaying by mid-season and entering in a kinda loop of what I'm gonna call 'reminders' - remind me that love, remind me that song, remind me that character's line. And that love (again)... over and over- There's practically none of that here. The characters (and the writing) are busy enough through the 20 episodes not to fall in that cliché. Keeps the bar pretty high through the entire season.As for the acting.. Oh, boy. It's been some time since I loved every single one of the characters in a show. And I don't want to spoil anything to those whom might read this lines. The outstanding support cast does a fantastic job. The main characters are first class. Song Joong-ki, and Yeo-bin Jeon are great in their roles. But I would give an award to every one of the characters (that lawyers, that father, mother, that brothers, that community) as they made me happy and sad and laugh and cry and frightened and relief. You are amazing. I'll remember you. No question.P. S. Hi, good people from Studio Dragon. That goes for you as well. Keep the bar high. Thank You.",10,19 May 2021," If you wonder if modern s.korean TV shows could get even better...yes, they can!

/title/tt13433812/,"Entertaining, gripping plot. Once you start watching, you just won't be able to stop. Yes, the plot is this good and Song Jongki's acting is top-notch. The chemistry between the leads is off the charts, though it's not a romantic drama, and there is a good amount of comedy, which balances the darker scenes. I would describe Vincenzo as an emotion rollercoaster, sometimes you are laughing out loud and are then taken aback by a dramatic, suspenseful scene. What I didn't like was the portrayal of Vincenzo in the last episodes, something which I will not spoil happened and he seemed far too passive and unprepared compared to how badass and cunning he had been shown to be. However, the ending did the character justice, so it was realistic enough. All in all, this drama is top-notch for me. If you are wondering whether or not to watch this, just do it already.

/title/tt13433812/,"As someone who has never seen k-drama I was hesitant to watch this at first. But after giving it a try I can say without a doubt, that this is definitely an amazingly well-crafted Thriller series.The show has really great themes on the ascepts of Justice and Human evil, with a lot of well-crafted plot twists that wouldn't know what would happen next. It takes a lot of Italian mafia elements and makes it into it's own style. I also hear that a lot of k-drama have some excess amounts of romance and rom-com but Vincenzo isn't one of those, there are obviously romance scenes here and there, but they're at a tolerable amount and do not distract you from the main story, it's primary focus is the Thriller and comedy aspects.It's a perfect blend of Thriller, Action and Comedy although I'll agree that not everyone can get accustomed to the k-drama-esque comedy and may even find it cringey at times.

Hands down the best show combining thriller, comedy, and action I have ever watched. Yes, every show out there has it flaws, but some of the moments and emotions this show gave me, ranging from sadness, joy, humour, nerve-wrecking excitement and so on, was just incredible.

/title/tt13433812/,"Just finished watching the season finale, having watched 1-2 episodes of Vincenzo every day.I started watching it on Netflix UK out of idle curiosity after seeing the giant thumbnail. I got hooked, and so did my family. I'm someone who has accidentally got into KDramas due to lockdown.Vincenzo is a superb thriller, with comedy breaks in it to reduce the tension when it gets too taut.It as about 4 plots, sub-plots, and is (except for the occasional lapse) VERY well written. And the writers delight in mixing genres- gangster, legal drama, heists- to name but a few. And they delight in fooling the audience.It is EXTREMELY well cast.Song Joong-ki is phenomenal in the title role. Cool, a strategist, always elegantly suited and booted, he plays a Korean who was adopted by Italians and grew up in a Mafia family, rising to the role of consigliere. He uses his intellect against opponents, taking on corrupt lawyers, politicians, businessmen, judges, prosecutors.But he can also be extremely violent when necessary.Jeon Yeo-been is also well cast as a feisty, designer clad, relentless, sharkish corporate lawyer Hong Cha-young, turned fighter for justice who becomes his partner in legal vigilantism after her idealistic father is murdered by corporate baddies.The villains are many. And varied in their villainy. K-Dramas can do female villains extremely well, some are absolutely frightening and Kim Yeo-jin was a standout as a truly evil woman, Choi Myung-hee, a lawyer more deadly than any thug. The ultimate baddy is terrifying. A psychotic sadist who can be harming one minute, vicious the next. Don't want to give the actor's name as he's a surprise twist!The supporting cast were amazing. I became a huge fan of the actors who portrayed the shopkeeper-residents of an ageing mall...where years before a Chinese criminal and Vincenzo had hidden in a vault under the mall basement, billions worth of gold bars statues... and a usb stick with info on corrupt bigshots in Korea that could bring down the rich and powerful. The mall residents have their own stunning reveals, in the twisting, turning plot.Vincenzo's departure from Italy after a brief power struggle, returning to Korea to retrieve the gold, is the catalyst for a roller coaster chain of events that had me and my family gasping, shrieking, hiding our eyes, and bingeing on this dramatic feast. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was some unnecessary weakness in the writing in parts of the last 2 episodes.I can't recommend it too highly.",9,17 June 2021," Phenomenal

/title/tt13433812/,"I highly recommend this to anyone that likes the revenge theme. It also feels very different from other k-series. It does not get cheesy nor fluffy. It stays serious until the very last episode. In my opinion it was an acceptable end because we all know there is no way out of mafia and the main character does not turn 'back good', he stays true to himself that he is not a good person and what he has done can't be undone or justified. I feel sorry for Jang Han seo because I really liked his character. He started to grow and be truly free of his abusive brother that's why I felt sorry for him but hey, it was his own decision to put a fight. Anyway, it has some comedy as well along the line but the same time it's a solid serious to watch.",10,18 June 2021," Unique series!

/title/tt13433812/,"As someone who loves violence, plot twists and thrillers, this kdrama has rarely anything at all. The story is very dull leading to many plot holes and bad character writing.

/title/tt13433812/,"Dear Vincenzo CastHello this is a Fan of Vincenzo drama. First off all I thank the makers of the drama for gifting me with such a great piece of work. All the things including CGI were great. The acting cast as well as staff did their job as perfectly as they could not giving me a single chance to find a mistake. I am really satisfied with the drama. Its may 2 today and the last episode was aired today. I was really waiting for this episode as well as didn't wanted this drama to end, but as we all were anticipated for a great and happy ending. It was thrilling. This drama made me laugh, cry when Jang Han Seo died (I am angry with this one. I was crying for about half and hour😢) , made me feel better. I had the best experience of my life throughout these 20 episodes. I lived my life in this world with all of them. Anticipated for season 2.Kimaya,

/title/tt13433812/,"This movie is in Korean with English subtitles. Each episode is around 1.5 hours and there are 20 episodes. That's almost 30 hours of my life I'd spend reading subtitles- I was not about to do that. Never!!!However, the first 5 minutes caught me like a mouse in a mouse trap. I couldn't stop watching. It's a lovely series. It's over the top, sometimes exaggerated, the overacting is funny and just works. The serious moments are on point. The slow motion shots make me chuckle- Everything just works.Vincenzo Cassano in an Italian suit made me feel bad about myself. I went and got cleaned up after watching the series- no more sloppy jeans and tees for me.This of just one of those things in life that you'll just totally love or totally hate.

/title/tt13433812/,"This is one of the best K-Drama I've ever watched, aside from Reply 1988. If you're a person who can't stand too much romance, this is the K-Drama for you. Even those who never watched any K-Drama love this one.It's genuinely funny, it made my day. All of the cast's acting are so good and entertaining.This is basically an action comedy series wrapped in the world of lawyers and mafia. Almost like those crime movies the people love but 100% more entertaining.The writing is genius, the plot is quite unpredictable. The crisis are well-developed, and the character's solutions for it are impressive - almost unthinkable. The conversations are natural and hilarious, even the smallest details are well-thought of and well-executed.The character's backstory and motives that pushes them are strong, so strong that you won't just fall in love with the heroes but also with the villains.",10,5 June 2021," Genuinely funny yet full of tensions, without too much romance.

/title/tt13433812/,"You can see the cast had a lot of fun making this Italian/Korean would-be mafia thriller, the sort of fun NOT experienced in Hollywood since the days of Burt Reynolds. Vincenzo contains a very absorbing plot, a cast star-struck by designer clothes, interspersed with Italian (and other) Classical music excerpts to set in relief some well written suspense and intrigue. The plot centers on, if we really are to believe it, the endemically CORRUPT upper echelons of S. Korean society. Is it a coincidence that many of the systemic abuses of power and institutional vice that constitute Vincenzo's Main Plot are now also going on, this very moment in the USA? It is certainly food for thought. A clear advantage this Korean drama has over mediocre US shows, however is a much softer-handed use of violence, resorting more often to satire to keep the plot moving as opposed to gratuitous savagery now so common in so-called ""hit"" US shows. So far, so good, Binjenzo!",8,23 August 2021," one of the Best Korean Web Series

/title/tt13433812/,"Watch at least the first 4 episodes and I promise the drama will grow on you! :) You will be wishing each episode is just a click away! Series starts off as though it is going to be an action movie, then turns a bit to a treasure hunt, then turns into a redemption movie, then comedy, then suspense-thriller and uh, even a bit of horror at one point lol. I have to say that probably in all the dramas I've ever watched, I have never quite felt such a broad mix of emotions in watching just ONE drama, but this is not a complaint at all. I seriously need to compliment the writers and director and actors/actresses for doing an amazing job mixing so many elements into one, and most importantly succeeding in the mix!Please make more dramas like Vincenzo! Truly a most enjoyable watch and this could probably be a textbook study for how to successfully mix many genres into one :PTo those with complaints on the silly/comedic parts of the show.. just enjoy it, real life is too serious as it is and its nice to have comic relief no?Oh, and interesting life lesson (though almost definitely unrealistic) from the latest episode I watched - being nice to pigeons could literally save your life one day =p.",10,20 April 2021," Wonderful mix of action, thriller, comedy, probably the best Korean drama so far!

/title/tt13433812/,"Vincenzo had an interesting start however when the main character goes back to Korea things start to get a bit silly....I think the first episodes when other characters are introduced are fine but later on a lot of time is wasted on the other building residents and honestly a lot of the times they don't add much to the plot and every time they appeared forced jokes are shown and maybe because of the cultural differences that I might not get, so me personally didn't find it funny at all.Also when they are on a trial everything is silly the acting of the actors like the judge and the main protagonist, so for me that kinda ruined this part of the trial episodes, I expected something a bit more serious...Honestly I found the brothers more interesting then the main characters, especially junwoo, I think his acting was the best out of everyone else, he showed different personas and face expressions in comparison with the main character Vincenzo that most of the time had a serious and cool image.The ending was fine kinda violent did not expected that due to the episodes being mostly ""comedic"".

/title/tt13433812/,"I wanted so much for this to be a 10 star rating after watching the first episode. I was complete blown away by Song Joong Ki's multilingual abilities in playing Vincenzo, the real Italian backdrop, the international mafia storyline. It really seemed all so promising.However, all this comes to a lukewarm plateau in the next few episodes, where Vincenzo ends up in South Korea and begins executing his mission of extracting gold from the basement of a rundown shopping plaza. It was heartwarming to see the him be reacquainted with the Korean life he had left behind as an orphaned child adopted by Italian foster parents, but I had already been sold on the hard mafia opening in the beginning.What was most disturbing for me was that the entire series opened with the scene of him bombing the shopping plaza where the gold was hidden, but in the end, this was never realized. I was really looking forward to see how he would manage convincing the residents of the plaza to move out so that he could destruct the plaza and extract the gold, but this was never realized.In fact, the entire plot became lost in a mushy romantic comedy between him and Jeon Yeo been's quirky yet lovable character Hong Cha Young, instead of the international action thriller it promised to be in the first episode. It became a story of how an Italian Korean reenacted his love for his countrymen, and how much his countrymen revered the Italian mafia, rather than a high intensity shootout or face off between him and his enemies with Italian mafia involvement on both sides to increase the tension.At the end of it, I felt not only lost but deceived. As much as I love the cast and the screenplay, it wasn't what it sold itself to be. It wasn't consistent, even though it was enjoyable for most parts.",7,3 June 2021," Great opening and acting, but inconsistency in plot

/title/tt13433812/,"To the people claiming that the characters are overacting; this is a COMEDY. And an excellent slapstick one at that. The show really picks up pace after episode 4, and it doesn't stop - the twists and turns are endless. Not a lot of kdramas can keep my attention for the whole run, but this definitely takes the cake for suspense, drama and the laughs.

/title/tt13433812/,"Started off slow for me, after episode 3 I fell in love with the story and cast. Since then the enjoyment level has been a steady incline, episode 10 being the peak. I've never watched any Joong Ki dramas before but definitely swooning over him now in this character. Yeo Been is an exemplary female lead and a great personality to play Chayoung. A great combination of comedy, gore, plotting and a sprinkle of romance! Overall I have high expectations for this show, very worth watching - trust me, it just gets better!EDIT: Still holding true to my review, this drama doesn't fail to keep you on your toes! I'm absolutely loving the story but most of all the slow burn romance! A MUST WATCH. Just hunker down for the first 3 episodes and I PROMISE it's so worth it!EDIT: Finished the series, it's A MASTERPIECE, I'm so sad it's over. I love this series so much, it's unhealthy. What a great ending, things were wrapped up very nicely, but I'm hoping for a season 2. Fingers crossed!",10,22 March 2021," Enjoying it more than I expected to!

/title/tt13433812/,"From the very first episodes, it's easy to find the story, plot work, pacing,... was all done perfectly. From how Vincenzo is introduced (I hate how unrealistic the fire spread though) to the schemes, how strong Babel is build as an unpenetratable image.. All could've been something more than this. Yet it might've been this brilliant style which killed the show.First of all: Everything was done perfectly right-on-time like a 2nd grade fomula. Yes good pacing can sometime do great, like how it hyped people's feelin when Joon Woo show off his identity (uwu gud stuff). But what's unforgivetable is how it breaks the beautiful setting that this show provided. We all know lucky moments and coincidences are sometime acceptable as it's reasonable to happen and will only make the scenes more awesome. But bruh not in this case, bc they freakin spammed it! The amount of oopsie moments that were created only for the shake of helping the protagonist and his companions are immesurable. Remember how Vincenzo and plaza owner closed the shelter's door right on time in ep ? Or when he arrive just b4 main girl of the show have her face punched? These little but ugly details totally ruined my experience as it's bland out unrealistic.Secondly: Weak character building followed up by weak script. Seriously, Paolo the gangster boss is nothing but a bullied child who dare do nothing, even can't take revenge on Vincenzo's driver when his master is abroad. And I was totally dissapointed seeing how Vincenzo easily kidnapped, tortured, got information from frankly any bad guys. It's like his aura of a normal build little baby face man and some weak measures of suffering could scare the f*ck out of everyone. Not to say no guard or security plan is effective against a korean mafia boy who works alone to invade Babel's domain and employees. Also, the poducers liked to spam backup saveboats that litterally turns the tide of the show. Oh Vincenzo is in trouble? Don't worry, he's rich and knows martial art at a superior rate! Oh plaza civilians are in danger? Don't care cause all of them know how to fight, and some are even masters of brawls. And you won't need me to speak out loud how trashy nerfed Ant Company was, right? (Although I hate it when the members of goverment and important people keep showing up to help willingly for no particular reason more)
Hmm, at this rate I think further criticism is unnecessary as you may've all now capable of looking at that overrated mess called Binsenjo Cassanova with a more precise perspective. For me myself, well the only reason I watched it to the end is 'cause of Joon Woo's actin, plot and role (as it's acted brilliantly with some manners of being the most realisticccc and No.1 part of the whole show uwu)
Brrrr idk but if your taste is of not very high standard, this TV-series can still entertain you well...... to a certain level that is.",6,23 April 2021," A shinny and precious pear with endless potential.... had been wasted

The female lead's acting is over the top, and also not convincing or funny. Always liked this male lead, but i guess the story just drags on with not much happening for many episodes.

/title/tt13433812/,"I dont know where to start.. its not even the acting. Maybe its a cultural thing for me and I am not used to asian movie making although I did enjoy Kingdom and Stranger. This one however.. First of all: the soundtrack is totally over dramatic throghout the first 20 minutes. Its on a 100% thrill all the time without there being any thrill that would justify such an intense soundtrack.Then there is the way he burns a whole estate down in slow motion in the beginning and then does the whole ""cool guys dont look at explosions"" kind of walk.Then he snaps the sim card and drops it in his glass of champagne.. its almost like a parody of every hollywood stereotype from the 80s but its just not meant as one.Worst scene however - and we are still talking first 20 minutes here - was when he said ""Papa"" to the dead patron.. I mean theres a South Korean guy who looks like hes 15 years old standing in front of his patrons coffin and then just says ""Papa"" and nothing else. Sorry but this show does not even come close to 6* if it was rated objectively.As i said, might be a cultural thing but I just cant take this seriously and it seems to me that a bunch of people just gave 10/10 ratings because the want to boost korean film making or the genre. Its doesnt even come close to shows like The Wire, Chernobyl, Gane of Thrones, True Detective, Narcos or House of Cards and yet its very close to their rating.

/title/tt13433812/,"Just finishing Episode 8 of Vincenzo and am enjoying the series. Haven't watched many of these Courtroom Battle scenarios as they tend to be a bit to dry and serious. Can't say that a about Vincenzo though. At every episode so far I've had a great laugh due to the great characters and actors playing their part. Taecyeon is excellent as Jang Jun woo, love the way he has transitioned between his Lawyer role and the CEO, all by just changing the expression on his face. Kwak Dong Yeon is one of my favourite actors from way back in ""Never Twice"" and "" Love in the Moonlight"". He is Jang Jun Woo's brother in this series. It's a big change of role from what I've seen him in and I was a bit shocked, he is scary at times, but excellent a tings. Kim Yeo Jin as Choi Jung Hee is scaring me to death, she is some badass Prosecutor, I hate her tactics in this role but she is some good actress. Now Vincenzo (Song Joon Ki), he's so cool as Mafia Lawyer, I've only seen him in Decendants of the Sun, and didn't leave much impression, but here he is rocking it. I'm impressed. I'm having such fun and laughter watching this, my dog runs out of the room when I Laugh too loud.

/title/tt13433812/,"When I read the summary of the show I was expecting a show which had elements of thriller, mystery, action and a well made mafia plot. But all I got was a wannabe mafia or legal drama which had comedy all over the place. It wasn't even a proper mafia or legal drama as there were hardly any courtroom scenes or any real mafia elements. The writers dragged this show for way too many episodes and most of the times Vincenzo doesn't even think like a consigliere who worked for the mafia. Even after so many attempts of accidents and killing, he doesn't think that it's wise to hire more amount of bodyguards for the people who are close to him. There are so many incidents which he could have avoided if he actually behaved like a consigliere. In the ending of episode 19 suddenly Vincenzo was dumb and weak. If you are a fangirl/fanboy of the lead character then you will love this show. But if you wanted to see a well made show like ""Vagabond"" then this convuluted mess isn't for you. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching the show because of the geumga plaza people and their comedy, but I was expecting something serious. Still I am giving this show a 6 star, only because all the actors did a great job, the cinematography was great and the soundtrack was really good!

The drama makes you hate the villian(jang ho seok) and at the same time makes you fall in love with actor (Ok taecyon) cuz he's so good at it. And everyone else as supporting characters are also out standing. You will fall in love with the Geugum plaza family. Finale will leave you overwhelmed. Totally recommended.",10,3 May 2021," SUCH UNIQUE AND WONDERFUL DRAMA.

/title/tt13433812/,"If this show keeps up the pace after 8 episodes, it gets a 10.What could be more ""fish out of water"" than a native Korean raised in Italy who is both an attorney and Consigliore to the Mafia? Yet from that seemingly absurd mix comes a basic plotline that makes complete hash out of any lawyer show you have ever seen, mixes serious violence, mayhem and murder with humerous come-uppances to the bad guys, and has an undercover cop deciding that our hero isn't Mafia at all--but a heroic version of Che Guevera? The first few episodes need a bit of time to shake out, but when they get going, it's wonderful. Favorite scene to date--the corrupt judge who is stung by hornets in his classroom. I'm no good at remembering their names, but the female lead overdoes it a bit, particularly in the beginning. Vincenzo is terrific right from the beginning. Co-stars and regulars are also wonderful. The actors are all having great fun, and it shows. I hope there is room left at the end for another season-or 10.",9,19 March 2021," Black humor, with a Kimchee bite

/title/tt13433812/,"I dont know where to start.. its not even the acting. Maybe its a cultural thing for me and I am not used to asian movie making although I did enjoy Kingdom and Stranger. This one however..
First of all: the soundtrack is totally over dramatic throghout the first 20 minutes. Its on a 100% thrill all the time without there being any thrill that would justify such an intense soundtrack.Then there is the way he burns a whole estate down in slow motion in the beginning and then does the whole ""cool guys dont look at explosions"" kind of walk.Then he snaps the sim card and drops it in his glass of champagne.. its almost like a parody of every hollywood stereotype from the 80s but its just not meant as one.Worst scene however - and we are still talking first 20 minutes here - was when he said ""Papa"" to the dead patron.. I mean theres a South Korean guy who looks like hes 15 years old standing in front of his patrons coffin and then just says ""Papa"" and nothing else. Sorry but this show does not even come close to 6* if it was rated objectively.As i said, might be a cultural thing but I just cant take this seriously and it seems to me that a bunch of people just gave 10/10 ratings because the want to boost korean film making or the genre. Its doesnt even come close to shows like The Wire, Chernobyl, Gane of Thrones, True Detective, Narcos or House of Cards and yet its very close to their rating. Please people stop abusing the rating, it should be objectively and not a vehicle for national pride or cultural preferences.",2,19 May 2021," horrible

/title/tt13433812/,"Where do I begin? I was hooked from the start, yet I wanted to do justice to this show by submitting a holistic review only when all 20 episodes were aired. Do not jump to premature conclusions or dislikes, you will lose in the end.Vincenzo is an up-to-date cinematographic homage to Balzac's Human Comedy and Dante's Divine Comedy, depicting nowadays society and performing a yo-yo between black comedy, pure drama, surreal fiction, bitter satire and slow-burned, realistic romance. All packed beautifully courtesy to the talent, hard work, creativity and dedication of the cast and staff.Why 10 stars when there's no perfection in this world? Because Vincenzo is enough and superb in its imperfections. Because it's addictive and memorable. Because it will change something in you while watching it.The Director and Writer did a great job, hats off for their teamwork and mutual understanding upon what this drama stands for. It's clear they had cohesion in the making of this drama. And they challenged the so often all-seen stereotypes and tropes some might expected to get in a Mafia show. The concept used and the mise-en-scene created a refreshing masterpiece!Each episode ends in style, with dramatic or unexpected cliffhangers that will keep you hooked like crazy, trying to guess what's next. And in most cases you'll fail to anticipate correctly.This show display meaningful character developments and human typologies. The chemistry between the cast was palpable and genuine. They were acting like a real team. It was the first time I watched the BTS of a movie/serial to understand how was that possible with such abundance of actors. The Geumga Plaza tenants it's us, the society, for sure. Each is unique individually, powerless when separated, yet with impact when awaken and united, catalyzed around a higher scope than just miserly surviving.The villains were manny and diverse, in accordance with the saying ""the evil is prevalent and vehement"". The Mafia was a concept perfectly used to explain the evil presence and ugly realities like corruption, greed, criminality, betrayal and dehumanization. Yet, small acts of good and humanity here and there saves this drama from a mere nihilism message.The romantic side is discreet, like a footnote, presented meaningfully to contrast with the atrocities around. And being powerful and memorable against all ods thanks to the great and candid chemistry of leading actors. It's the first time I am proud of how this feeling was portrayed between a man and a woman. No cheesy childish tropes, no toxic behaviour, vulgarity or skinship displayed, yet you know that longing and love is there come hell or high water. Also solid partnership, trust, respect and friendship is there, despite comic bickering. It's the healthiest relationship between two lonely people that meet unexpectedly at the crossroads of a toxic, corrupt environment. Being an anti-hero or simply villains is a lonely job, that comes with personal losses and sacrifices. Remembering the stares between Vincenzo and Cha Young along the entire show, but mostly at the end of episode 20, those two pairs of eyes broke me. Makes you wonder what price are we willing to pay in order to stand for each other or f right what is wrong?The OST and BGM of this drama is so emotional and powerful, beyond all expectations! When associated with scenes from Vincenzo it becomes a powerhouse. I'm still listening to it, vividly.Memorable, mature lines and scenes will sink deep in your head and soul because of their innate relatability. You will also laugh like crazy while ordering a corn salad. You will start seeing pigeons in a different light. And the sound of someone toying with a lighter around you will inevitably make you feel that things are about to escalate.All in all, you will want to watch the show more than once, hoping for a season 2, sequel, spinoff or whatever crumbs of Vincenzo are possible. Yeah, first time to give 10 stars to a show, wholeheartedly!",10,27 May 2021," Superb drama! A refreshing masterpiece with a plot unfolds progressively until you become addicted and troubled by the emotions invested.

Romance is not the main track but still the slow romance was better than most of the romance k-dramas I have seen.Even though the tenants scenes were a bit boring in the beginning, you start investing in their story as the episodes roll.

There is one ep that seems, one scene being repeated tends to be boring and makes it difficult for the audience to digest the next story. However, because we were surprised by other actions, we were made to forget about those shortcomings for me.Second, Vincenzo is helped by Inzaghi and his friends. It really doesn't make sense, science actually exists. There is a sense of wonder and also strange in me.But if it can be corrected, Vincenzo should have been defeated at that point, it will make the audience feel disappointed and then more enthusiastic to watch it.There is no scine Vincenzo loses, as if the plot is very imposing the plot, to make the villain continue to be weak. In terms of plot, it may have been planned that this story would be like this, type.",10,12 October 2021," A beautiful story with a luxurious style, especially one that plays my favorite actor.

Every character is perfect, the calm & cool/introverted Vincenzo, the crazy & warm hearted/extroverted Chayoung & the rest of the crew..Sincerely the director gathered the best cast👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾...This drama had it all,dark comedy, romance,thriller,action..Just name it!..So go ahead & watch it!!!The best decision you make on Drama Selection this year...Judge for yourself.",10,15 November 2021," The Best 2021 KDrama...

/title/tt13433812/,"Cha Young grew on me to be honest. I came for SJK but I fell for JYB.I love the fact that towards the ending of the drama cha young seemed to calm down a bit thanks to her relationship to Vincenzo but also loved that the writer didn't deviate from cha Young's character at the court scene in episode20. I was so happy seeing her being that weird & sassy Lawyer again..I like the fact that their relationship wasn't about changing themselves, they instead balanced & accepted each other & were a team!!!..He's (Vincenzo) like her bomb detonator...So whipped for her, always ready to defend her /back her up when she goes crazy
I loved how he always got her back
I enjoyed all their moments
For folks saying Cha Young's character was overly dramatic.Don't forget ;
1) This is a dark comedy genre
2) Vincenzo's personality is stoic & introverted...Cha young was created by the writer to balance this..
3) Opposites attract..Ying to Yang(Cencha couple)..
4)She's not your regular FL that's dependent on the man..She's bold,assertive, smart,gets into the game,proactive, weird ,funny & down to earth..
5) The Guemza plaza people were dramatic too(that's how they are real life by the way)
6) It would have been boring & annoying if the FL was submissive(no offense to women who have those personalities,we love you)...A lot of strong women in the 21st century can relate with the extroverted Cha Young
Thank you JYB for your perfect expression of Lawyer Hong Cha Young.",10,15 November 2021," Just before you give up on the drama....

/title/tt13433812/,"I read some of the other reviews, where people are criticizing the stereotyping of Italian Mafia.But the TV series isn't about Italian Mafia at all so lets just forget about that.I love the characters so much, Vincenzo is shown to be level-headed and is ofcourse another Korean awesome hero but still is isn't shown to be invincible and can't predict everything.The daughter is shown to be smart goal oriented but still human, with our own fallacies and shortcoming.

Together they work together with a strange but unique people. The show has action, suspense, romantic, and thrill.

We are not even at a level of quality where it is worth to have an actual discussion about what's to like and what's not.I could see this as a 6/10 considering fans skewing the rating, but what the hell is up with all the 9 and 10s?

/title/tt13433812/,"My actual rating for this show would be a 9.5 but I don't mind rounding it up to 10 because:Everything about this series was dripping in sheer Quality! From the visual effects, the script, the instrumentals and songs, the editing, the costumes, the sets, to the performances of the actors, each scene was oozing with magic. Each episode felt like a movie - I was satisfied with the plot that unfolded per episode but was also left with a yearning to see the next one.The baddies were so colorful and basically pure evil and even though you hated them you appreciated them anyway. This show had a lot of supporting roles but I was invested in every single character on this show. They were a lot, but it never felt crowded. Each character had a soul and identity and it showed throughout this show's 20 episode run.And lastly I want to highlight the outfits in the show! Everyone was SO classy! Especially, SJK and JYB! SJK served his looks in literally EVERY SCENE. Both his and JYBs outfits were on point all the time, I was constantly blown away because they looked so good!This show is almost perfect. I say almost (and the reason for my 0.5 point deduction) because I wish there were more fluff/romantic scenes between the two leads!!! After everything these characters went through (and because my thirsty inner-self craved it), I wanted to see more PG13/R action between V and HCY. I'm not saying I'm not happy with the scenes they had (I am), I just wish they had MORE.Anyway, this is a solid Drama and you should watch it!",10,3 May 2021," Action, Humor, Romance, Suspense, and LOTS OF GOOD LOOKS

I knew that Vincenzo the man himself would be the deciding factor on whether this show will take off or not. My goodness! When it came time for Vincenzo to deliver he NEVER missed a beat. He was the focal point and orchestrater of how well the show will flow. When the show finally took off it never took its foot off the gas! The supporting cast made the ride EVEN MORE enjoyable!

/title/tt13433812/,"This is not a fan-friendly review. Although the series is not the best, it is a good series that several chapters can be rescued but not all. At first we are used to very long chapters, a bit empty, they have top moments that hook you but a thread is lost in the critical attention of those who see it. There are chapters that I consider to be really good like some initials and some endings, but 20 chapters are not necessary, chapters that if you skip, you will still understand the plot and you did not miss anything, clearly it is not a piece of art, because it does not have The best photograph is very long, there are characters that do not have nuances, such as the antagonist, who dehumanizes someone only to have feelings of evil, or to hook up with a character who practically only at the end realizes the love he feels for the girl , which we must question because at this point in history it is not healthy to continue having this type of concept about love as a couple. Now, there are chapters that are really good for the nuances of some characters, for the Korean humor, for the impeccability of the script, for the photography of some landscape scenes, for the costumes. But I insist that a maximum of 10 chapters would be good, not 20 because I feel that in addition to saying good, some are not so good but I already invested a considerable time I have to finish it to see the outcome that is anticipated in the acting of the characters from the initial chapters .The development of the relationship between the characters is seen throughout the story, but I question the way a character is idolized in this case a man in the role of savior. In short, it is not a bad criticism but a constructive and obvious one, I love this actor and many of his characters, I like many things about him as an actor and seeing many characters from other series that are still really incredible in their acting roles.",7,7 June 2021," It's good but not the best, the good and bad.

/title/tt13433812/,"This text is about the dialogue of Vincenzo Cassano, who incorrectly said that King Cambyses had skinned one of the corrupt judges while he was alive.During the reign of Cambyses, one of the
Achaemenid kings, bribery were considered a crime and the penalty was death.After the execution of one of the corrupt judges, Cambyses removed his skin and, as a cover, placed it on a judge's chair, to be a lesson to others.The author of this series must answer why he told such a horrible lie? Cambyses tore the skin of a corrupt judge after his execution, not while he was alive.I know that even though he was dead, he should not have cut off his skin, which is wrong.But the author also did a terrible job and compared we Iranians to the Barbarians and He described us as savages and bloodthirsty people. That such a description is not acceptable at all and is a horrible lie. If the author has narrated this story in the script with full knowledge, then his work is intentional and distorts the history of our country And he must apologize to us Iranians.",9,2 May 2021," We want writer's apology

At first, I decided to watch it because i want to look for another genre besides rom-com, plus the cast is Joongki (one of my fav actors). This drama is very fun to watch! It has a dark-mistery, fun, thrilling and so on. Those actors and actress acting skills are really amazing, knowing that joongki/Vincenzo who speaks Italian very great several times!

Foreign actors are so bad at acting and all their acts were so forced especially the trying-to-be-funny scenes, the series was boring for me because of how poor the transitions of scenes were, especially the forced comedy. I'll edit my review once the series has ended, and i really hope the story line will be good because it is the only reason i might change my rating.

Slow burn for the last 5 minutes. You really see the Consigliere. This episode by itself gives the drama 9 stars. Although, now I don't know how they'll keep a balance of humor within the story for the last four episodes. #16 set a high bar for the last four.I think Ms Oh knew all along.My prediction: Ms. Choi is going to survive. He will not kill her. Remember episode 1. No women and no kids. That's why Vincenzo doesn't respect Paolo. So, she survives but lives in fear.Maybe Hong Cha-young will do it in another episode or Jang Han Seok or Mr Han or Jang Han-Seo. It won't be Vincenzo.

/title/tt13433812/,"I've watched Vincenzo until ep.18 (out of 20), so I guess it's already acceptable for me to write a review. My feeling about this series : unfortunately, really really disappointed.The reason why I watched this series is because I was intrigued by the genre : a mixture between politic, thriller, action, and comedy. The first few episodes are quite fun. But that fun only last for approximately the first 10 episodes. Even in the first 10 episodes, I already found several issues that bothered me. For example, why is Cha-Young fighting against her dad in the first place? There's no backstory whatsoever about why she chose to work in Woosang despite how corrupted Woosang is (only for the money? I dunno). Then, there's Myung-Hee. What is her motive? What is the reason for her total support for Han-Seok despite their constant losing? Is she just downright 'evil'? And for Han Seok, I just can't believe the writer just explained his character as a psychopath. Don't tell me that this is not a lazy way to create an antagonist character.What annoyed me the most is actually what she and Han Seok keep on doing every single episode : an empty threat ""You'll regret it"", ""What if I kill you first?"" blah blah. Their method of winning is apparently : A doesn't want to cooperate? Kill A. B knows something he/she shouldn't? Kill B. C is acting annoying? Kill C.But of course Vincenzo will always outsmart them and win. If this only happens for like 2/3 episodes, I won't be so annoyed. But this pattern of handsome-and-perfect main lead that keeps winning against the 'bad guys', no matter how cliché it is (yes, Inzaghi, I see you), for every single episode, is just.. underwhelming.Han Seo is at least a more interesting character than Myung Hee or Han Seok. He shows change : once a shadow for his brother and was always afraid of him, but now finally has courage to fight against him and even becoming wittier.I mean, this series can be great, with a proper storyline. Probably a less perfect Vincenzo that can make mistakes sometimes. Probably a smarter and cunning antagonist that's actually 'do' something instead of just talking big and failed miserably..Don't get me wrong, I love the actors and actress. They saved the show. They saved the poor and lazy story writing. That's why I give the rating of 5 : despite the meh story writing, the CGI of Italy (and Inzaghi apparently) is beautiful and realistic, some of the comedic scene is quite funny, the cinematography is amazing, and the music they choose do compliments the atmosphere.But, in the end, nothing can really save a poor story.",5,27 April 2021," Disappointing :(

Enjoyment: 10/10.Overall: rounds up to 10/10If you like a witty, comedic, dark, gory, antihero story with a good splash of romance, you've come to the right place. I went into this series with no expectations. 2 episodes in, I felt enjoyment but no real spark. Then episode 3 passed and we went into the fourth episode; from there, the enjoyment of this series takes off exponentially. Each episode is action packed, meaningful, heart wrenching and fun. I've never enjoyed a show so much as I have this one. It's been an absolute pleasure to follow each weekly viewing live. The chemistry between the main leads is absolutely captivating.Vincenzo is going to leave an empty hole that no other drama can replace, and it's bittersweet knowing it's over.

Coming towards plot, the storyline is well scripted, each episode is we directed, all OSTs are awesome, chemistry between male and female lead is heart fluttering, the genre is amazing, you will be laughing 80% of times but there will be some serious moments and even cried when sjk cries.

You will be immersed in the moments when sjk cries, become angry, his gaze towards female lead, his passion, his guilty, his story.I won't give any spoiler but I can say if you are looking forward for ""not-cliche-cum-satisfying-ending"", please watch this series and support song joong ki like me.",10,3 May 2021," A one of its kind (mind-blowing) :p

/title/tt13433812/,"I've watched from start to end. The cast is perfect,it feels that the characters have come to life. The storyline is unique in between all those typical dramas. You have a very HOT mafia ;) and equally charming female lead.It has drama,soooo many twists but you won't feel lost,it will always leave you in the edge of the seat wondering what will happen next. It has comedy which relaxes the mood and...romance. Oh,it has a romance so good you'll fall in live with thus series,it isn't the typical romance. It shows two people being caring towards each other through small and subtle actions,it shows the two people understanding each other without the need to say anything.If you don't watch kdramas but want to try some,VINCENZO is the perfect one. I am VERY picky when to comes to movies,dramas,songs and all so I would say DEFENITELY go for vincenzo.If you need further convincing,I suggest got to youtube channel called ""The swoon"" it will give you enough tease to make you watch the show.",10,9 May 2021," Perfect in every Aspect

/title/tt13433812/,"How many times in Life do we experience things that give us waves of Goosebumps?Vincenzo is an extraordinary show with brilliant showcase of Talents from all the actors and kudos to everyone who made this show possible. Thanks to Netflix for making this show available in India with appropriate Subtitles.Song Joon-Ki (Vincenzo) is the cutest Mafia and HOW!!!Jeon Yeo-Been (Hong Cha-Young) is the best partner in crime. Loved her quirkiness in the show.Im Chulsoo (Ahn Gi-Seok) is the most fun-loving supporting actor as an Intelligent Service Agent.Entire star cast has done amazing job and unfolding of every character of the show is just so beautiful. I have never liked Kwak Dong-heon (Jang Han-seo) in any dramas before, but he is very impressive in this show. Villains of the show actually makes us feel uuggghhhhhh.Despite of being a crime thriller show, the partnership and chemistry of lead actors is what makes the show MOST SPECIAL. So mature so breath-taking and realistic. Vincenzo being a Mafia is shown to be Cold hearted but has a heart of Gold in real. He cannot be in any relationship given the dangers that come along. Just for that reason her mother was killed after 30 years of reuniting with her. Cha-young understands this and somewhere down the line they come close and start being like a couple and Vincenzo does things to make her happy and protect her. The fake proposal act they had to do was Real to them in their hearts. Finally, when Vincenzo confesses the love in words and yet leave her again, she still understands it. Just a fictional show but the feelings the audience can feel is Real True and Deep.Show has 20 episode and not for once it felt dragged. Action sequences were really enjoyable especially whenever Vincenzo would hold Gun and of course the Lighter.Inzhagi the pigeon act was pure genius. So was the entire Gay act by both the involved cast. It was brilliantly executed.Joon-Ki's and Yeo-Been's Shaman act was the best portrayal of their Versatility in acting.Soundtracks/OST not to be missed. I am always by your side by John Park is the perfect song that describes Vincenzo Cha-young relationship. MESMERISING.The piano/hacker girl helped to retrieve gold and so did the Monks and they kept a share for themselves. I get it. But other plaza members also helped a lot and were sincere and deserving of some gold if not a lot. They called themselves as Cassano Family with the growing attachment to Vincenzo which he reciprocated. In Finale they show 'After 1 year' and I was really hoping the lives of family & the plaza to be a improved version but it wasn't so. Plaza members even came forward to help the piano girl twice when in danger, so felt unfair for other members to not have a share.Subtitles do not give 100% justice and satisfaction of the show. If only everyone could understand the Korean language itself, the love for this show would be 1000 folds more.Already missing you Mr. Corn Salad.",10,20 May 2021," I found the gold in my heart with this.

/title/tt13433812/,"I think the writer's initially had a good idea and the basic plot had potential but then the writer's tried to way too much (ie. Tried to appeal to everyone and ended up with a too long ridiculous, stupid, and silly drama that I found to get worse with every episode.) I did like the early episode and the main character and main villain, hence the 3 stars). I cannot recommend this drama and unlike other kdramas I would not feel sad if the building collapsed and killed all the characters (well maybe I would shed one tear for Vincenzo).",3,9 June 2021," Ridiculous, silly and stupid and overrated

/title/tt13433812/,"I've never been one to write reviews on movies or TV shows, but after just finishing Vincenzo, I can't resist the urge to share my thoughts!This show has been such an amusement park and I loved every single second of it! I won't spoil anything, but I'll give my thought on some of the different aspects of the show.The story (10/10):This show grabbed a hold of me within the first minutes. The beginning really set the atmosphere and painted the main character as a cold, calculated and mysterious person. I mean; who does not like a beginning that glues you to the screen right away. I have to be honest and say that I binged the whole show in a week due to the never ending captivity of Vincenzo and the story that unfolds around him. I'm hope I'm not biased, but this show had me from start to finish and for that I have to give the story, a top rating.The characters: (10/10)
As the show goes on, we get to know all the different characters, their personas, their believes and what their values are. All the characters are great and gives the show a perfect balance of excitement, comedy and sadness. I can honestly say that I was just as interested in Vincenzo as I was in the other characters. They all had their story unfold like a present thought out the show.The protagonists were great, the antagonists were very good and all the other side-characters were interesting. What more can you ask for?The music: (10/10)There is nothing more to say than ""Bellissimo!"" The music was used in a perfect manner, the choice of songs at certain moments were spot on and they really gave the show a good feeling of Italian and Korean. Much respect the the people who worked on the music for this show.This might seem like a very biased review, but I still can't shake the feeling I'm left with, now that I've finished the show. I want to watch it again! I want to experience the opening sequence, I want to hear the music and I want to see how it ends all over again! Brilliant show! Just brilliant! If you haven't watched it, then do it! I promise you won't regret it. I laughed, I cringed, I cried and I enjoyed my way thought this masterpiece! I hope you will do the same.If you've read this far, then I thank you for reading my thoughts about this show. Leave a like if you enjoyed reading about my extravagant experience with Vincenzo!",10,22 July 2021," A K-Drama masterpiece!

/title/tt13433812/,"Characters are completely idiotic, mainly the female lead, and the main lead, Vincenzo. The rest of the side characters are just annoying plot fillers. They don't contribute anything useful, just childish comedy no one finds funny. There are never really any stakes because of how thick the plot armor is so the ""tense music"" in scenes just gets more and more annoying every episode. Guns are often pointed just as a scare tactic, not really used, and it gets annoying really fast. Writers keep shying away from the actual plot because they know they don't have the guts to make a good plot that remains strong and consistent. Too many slow motion scenes that just were awful to endure, not because they were heartfelt, but because they were unnecessary and just dragged the episode out. It felt like the writers were just coming up with something random left and right just to have 20 episodes. The plot was complicated at first but it soon came with a simple solution...with two thirds of the show still left to fill up with gags and cringeworthy moments instead of the characters actually solving the problem. I would have stopped watching this at probably the fourth episode but the only reason I watched the rest was because my cousin wanted to finish it with me. I recommend watching this if you want to waste your time. If you don't, there are plenty of other crime/thrillers that you'll find much more captivating out there.",3,6 August 2021," a completely idiotic and childish show. still surprised how overhyped it is even with it being on Netflix.

Vincenzo is very powerfull man and you saw it..He has ability do whatever he says. And i thing he has the most powerful abilty: Gather the people and believe themselves.It was totaly joyfull to saw how the Vincenzo gathered all the people around and see them became Mafia like.Anyway if you want to watch this movie do it.",9,14 May 2021," Bravooo

/title/tt13433812/,"I saw a lot of people critiquing the first four episodes for being misled about this being a neo-noir crime show. My expectation however was another K drama with a darker theme.This turned out to be it, while the the first few episodes are more comedic in nature, the following episodes get darker and darker. The finale rides the line of a straight up torture film. The action was top notch but some of the comedy was a bit cringey. It didn't help that all the 'funny' scenes were accompanied by goofy jingles.Although the main villain turned out to be a character with little backstory he was still very intimidating. The show made you feel very sorry for the protagonists and most of the time I actively hated the villains.Besides the comedy I thought that the show had a few other weak points; the romance and the subplot about the gold stashed under a temple. The weird thing is that I could feel some chemistry between Vincenzo and Hong but besides two kisses and a hug there was not much romance. They probably cut it short because the show already had so much plot. The gold subplot is weak because it goes on for too long and the characters act in bizarre ways.On a positive note the rest of the show was good including the music and cinematography. There are some scenes where character's deaths are portrayed in very creative ways.In terms of structure I am starting to notice a pattern in K-dramas: 1. Set up the story in 3-4 episodes 2. Spend about 10+ episodes stretching out the story with twists and turns. 3. Resolve the story in 4 episodes where one of the main characters gets injured. 4. do a finale where the characters get to say goodbye or stay together and kiss.Overall the show is a solid 8 out of 10.",8,24 June 2021," Good K-Drama - Ending took it down a notch

/title/tt13433812/,"I saw clips from The Swoon about this show, and the more I looked at it, I was surprised to find this comedic yet action-oriented and conspiracy-filled take of a show around its Korean-Italian Mafia protagonist. I enjoy the cast of characters, the comedy, and the action, and so far, the show really has been quite a ride, in terms of having cliffhangers where the back-fill of explanation often can be quite crucial, but more than once, it's made me feel a sense of relief or despair. I don't think the posters or the trailer really can capture what duality this show has between the noir feeling at points vs. The truly absurd comedy, so it's confusing to tell what you're getting into, but by the time I hit episode 4 I started to realize that it was going to be a ride and by episode 10 I was just super invested in rooting for the characters. Now going to start episode 16, and I will come back to review to adjust it once I fully see the show.",10,27 April 2021," Seriously enjoying the ride and the cast
